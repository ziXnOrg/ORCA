# ORCA Cursor Rules Index

This directory contains authoritative rules for the ORCA project. Each rule is concise, enforceable, and maps to our Blueprint (`Docs/Blueprint.md`).

Available rules:

- agentic-architecture.mdc — Event-sourced execution, deterministic replay, budgets, isolation, policies
- observability.mdc — Tracing/logging/metrics policy and span naming
- testing-validation.mdc — Testing pyramid, coverage, CI gates, fuzz/property tests
- security-privacy.mdc — RBAC hooks, secrets, redaction, least-privilege sandboxing
- performance-optimization.mdc — Rust performance patterns, async, memory, profiling
- rust-standards.mdc — Style, lint, error handling, concurrency, crate layout
- python-standards.mdc — Style, lint, typing, tests for SDK/tools
- typescript-standards.mdc — Style, lint, strict TS, tests for SDK/tools
- roadmap-alignment.mdc — Phases, gates, traceability (Roadmap as source of truth)
- dev-log.mdc — Mandatory dev log discipline and template

Adopted defaults:
- All rules are always-on unless explicitly scoped.
- CI treats violations as errors (fail fast).
- Determinism, security, and auditability take precedence over convenience.
