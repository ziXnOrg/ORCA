### 2025-10-21 07:45 (UTC)

#### Area
Observability|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Integrate Jaeger visualization and provide setup docs.

#### Actions
- Added optional Jaeger exporter dependency under `telemetry` `otel` feature.
- Created `Docs/observability.jaeger.md` with Collector/Jaeger quickstart and env settings.
- Linked doc from `README.md`.

#### Results
- Clear path to visualize traces in Jaeger during Phase 4; feature-gated to avoid deps by default.

### 2025-10-21 07:35 (UTC)

#### Area
Docs|Phase3

#### Context/Goal
Add Phase 3 cost management guide and link from API HOWTO and README.

#### Actions
- Created `Docs/cost_management.md` (budgets, usage tracking, thresholds, telemetry, SDK behavior, troubleshooting).
- Updated `Docs/API/HOWTO.md` with budget usage and link to guide.
- Linked cost guide in `README.md`.

#### Results
- Users have a clear guide to configure budgets, interpret warnings/exceeded, and handle SDK errors.

### 2025-10-21 07:25 (UTC)

#### Area
Build|Tests|Runtime|Alignment

#### Context/Goal
Comprehensive alignment review: fix compilation errors, validate all tests, confirm Phases 0-3 + partial Phase 4 complete.

#### Actions
- Fixed Rust toolchain: upgraded to `stable` (supports icu deps).
- Fixed proto serde: enabled `Serialize`/`Deserialize` in `tonic_build`.
- Fixed orchestrator: added missing deps (`policy`, `budget`, `telemetry`, `serde_json`); made `index` public for tests; resolved borrow conflicts in policy/budget paths.
- Fixed event-log: added `Clone` derive to `JsonlEventLog`.
- Fixed integration tests: moved to `crates/orchestrator/tests/`; added `Orchestrator` trait import; fixed `spawn_server` tempdir lifetime; added `futures-util` dep.
- Fixed budget test: adjusted token limits to properly trigger exceeded state.
- Stubbed OTel metrics export (version conflict with `opentelemetry-otlp`; will refine in next iteration).

#### Results
- **Build**: ✅ `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` succeeds (warnings only).
- **Tests**: ✅ 14 tests pass across workspace:
  - `event-log`: 1 test (append roundtrip)
  - `orca-core`: 6 tests (IDs, envelope, metadata validation)
  - `orchestrator` lib: 2 tests (TTL rejection, idempotency)
  - `orchestrator` integration: 2 tests (happy path, TTL timeout)
  - `orchestrator` budget: 2 tests (warn/exceed, isolation)
  - `orchestrator` restart: 1 test (replay rebuilds index)
- **Phase 0**:  Complete (WAL, IDs, telemetry baseline, security stubs, CI, tooling)
- **Phase 1**:  Complete (orchestrator service, proto schema, contracts, TTL/retry, idempotency, WAL integration, tests)
- **Phase 2**:  Complete (SDK docs, metadata model, StreamEvents, recovery, mTLS/RBAC hooks, policy hooks)
- **Phase 3**:  Core complete (usage tracking, budgets, enforcement, metrics, tests); pending docs/SDK finalization
- **Phase 4**:  In progress (span coverage ✅, OTel export stub ✅, replay CLI ✅; pending Jaeger, log enrichment, debug guide)

#### Diagnostics
- Toolchain pinned to `stable` for forward compatibility.
- Proto-generated types now serde-compatible for policy/budget JSON workflows.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end gRPC flows, budget isolation, and crash recovery.
- OTel metrics export: stubbed due to `opentelemetry-otlp` 0.15 API mismatch with `opentelemetry_sdk` 0.22; will align versions in Phase 4 refinement.

#### Decision(s)
- **Toolchain**: Use `stable` channel for production readiness and ecosystem compatibility.
- **OTel metrics**: Stub for now; will wire OTLP exporter in Phase 4 final pass when deps align.
- **Integration tests**: Keep in `crates/orchestrator/tests/` for simplicity (workspace-level tests require separate crate).

#### Follow-ups
- [ ] Complete Phase 3: cost management guide, SDK budget examples finalization
- [ ] Complete Phase 4: Jaeger/Zipkin integration, log enrichment, debugging guide, redaction in traces
- [ ] Align OTel deps and wire real OTLP metrics export
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before next commit
- [ ] Update CI to run all integration tests

#### Area
Observability|Tools|Runtime

#### Context/Goal
Configure OTel OTLP metrics export and scaffold WAL replay CLI for time-travel debugging.

#### Actions
- Extended `telemetry` with OTLP HTTP metrics exporter (env-based: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TIMEOUT`).
- Created `crates/replay-cli` with `orca-replay` binary to iterate WAL events; supports `--run-id`, `--start-event-id`, `--interactive`.

### 2025-10-20 03:40 (UTC)

#### Area
Runtime|Observability

#### Context/Goal
Add span coverage for policy, budget, WAL, and stream operations.

#### Actions

#### Area
API|SDK|Runtime

#### Context/Goal
Wire SDK/tool token/cost hints into Envelope and orchestrator consumption; plan OTel metrics export next.

#### Actions

#### Results
- Per-agent breakdown logged; tests validate exceeded and isolation behavior.

### 2025-10-20 03:00 (UTC)

#### Area
Runtime|Budget|SDK|Docs

#### Context/Goal

#### Actions
- Added per-run `budgets_by_run` and `usage_by_run` with `usage_update` and `run_summary` events.
- Enforced thresholds (80/90) and `budget_exceeded` emission; parsed budgets from StartRun/env.
- Updated SDK quickstarts to pass budgets and handle `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` errors.

#### Context/Goal
Wire policy pre/post hooks (allow/deny/modify with redaction) and add budget counters/interfaces in prep for Phase 3.

#### Actions
- Implemented `policy::Engine` with pre/post hooks and PII redaction via regex; integrated around StartRun/SubmitTask.
- Added `budget::Manager` with token/cost counters and limit checks; integrated minimal token increment path.

### 2025-10-20 00:10 (UTC)

#### Area
Docs|Architecture

#### Context/Goal
Update Roadmap to reflect Rust-first core decision (from initial Python assumption).

#### Actions
- Rewrote Roadmap Phase 0–2 sections: orchestrator core is Rust from start; Python/TS SDKs are gRPC clients.
- Updated execution steps, security, and SDK integration sections accordingly.

#### Results
- Roadmap aligned with Rust-first architecture; no conflicting language assumptions remain.

### 2025-10-20 00:00 (UTC)

#### Actions
- Created `.cursor/rules`: agentic-architecture, observability, testing-validation, security-privacy, performance-optimization, rust-standards, python-standards, typescript-standards, dev-log, multi-agent-coordination, roadmap-alignment.
- Created `clippy.toml` (pedantic, nursery) and `rustfmt.toml` (width 100, stable defaults).

#### Results

### 2025-10-21 08:02 (UTC)

#### Area
Observability

#### Context/Goal
Harden metrics exporter: real OTLP pipeline, env-configurable, counters/histograms for budgets.

#### Actions
- Aligned OTel deps in `crates/telemetry/Cargo.toml`; enabled `rt-tokio` on SDK.
- Implemented OTLP metrics pipeline with `opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline().metrics(runtime::Tokio)`.
- Added counters/histograms: `orca.tokens.total`, `orca.cost.total_micros`, `orca.tokens.per_task`, `orca.cost.per_task_micros`.
- Rebuilt `telemetry` and `orchestrator` with `--features otel`.
- Updated docs `Docs/observability.jaeger.md` with metrics env vars and verification steps.
      
#### Results
- Build succeeded for telemetry/orchestrator with `otel` feature. Metrics ready for OTLP export.

#### Diagnostics
- Initial build failed due to version mismatches and API changes; fixed by removing `tracing-opentelemetry` for now and using runtime API for metrics.

#### Decisions
- Defer tracing layer hookup to avoid multiple `opentelemetry` versions; keep metrics export minimal and stable.

#### Follow-ups
- Re-introduce tracing subscriber layer once versions are unified and tested.
- Add integration test to assert metrics emission via mock collector.

### 2025-10-21 08:11 (UTC)

- Added filters: `--run-id`, `--from/--to`, `--since-ts-ms`, `--max`, `--dry-run`, `--interactive`.
- Built `replay-cli` binary successfully.

#### Results
- Usable CLI for investigating WAL and exporting run-specific traces to JSON.

#### Follow-ups

### 2025-10-21 08:18 (UTC)

#### Area

#### Context/Goal
Add determinism-focused tests for replay CLI (filters, ordering, to-trace output).

#### Actions
- Added unit tests in `crates/replay-cli/src/main.rs` covering range semantics, timestamp filters, max truncation, and deterministic JSON output for `to-trace`.
- Fixed test expectation to reflect half-open `[start, end)` semantics of `read_range`.

#### Results
- All 3 tests passed locally.

#### Follow-ups
- Add E2E test invoking orchestrator to produce WAL then verify CLI outputs equivalence.
