- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E2-OBS-09 (Audit + metrics for governance) by executing the standard end-of-task workflow steps 9–17: squash-merge PR #78 to main, close Issue #77, clean branches, sync main, re-run validations, and update documentation.
- Actions:
  - Verified PR #78 CI status: build-test (ubuntu/macos), coverage, otel-and-replay — all SUCCESS
  - Squash-merged PR #78 → main with title "feat(policy,orchestrator,telemetry): audit + metrics for governance (T-6a-E2-OBS-09)" and message "Closes #77"; recorded merge SHA
  - Closed Issue #77 with final comment and validation evidence; deleted branch feat/governance-observability (remote+local); synced local main (fast-forward)
  - Ran validations on main: `cargo fmt --all -- --check`; `cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings`; `cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture`
  - Updated Docs/TODO.md to mark T-6a-E2-OBS-09 complete in Quick Start and Phase 6a; appended this dev-log entry
- Results:
  - Main at merge commit: ded55570f83dce42a09293ea9996b8e5587c3afd; all validations PASS on main
  - Issue #77: CLOSED; PR #78: MERGED (squash)
- Diagnostics:
  - Observability compliance affirmed: span `agent.policy.check` with low-cardinality attrs {phase, decision_kind, rule_name}; metric `policy.decision.count` attrs {phase, kind, action} with alias emission allow_but_flag→flag; WAL audit reasons sanitized (SSN-like) before persistence
- Decision(s): Accept OTel observer + PII-redaction approach; no follow-ups required
- Follow-ups: None

- Area: Observability|Policy|Orchestrator
- Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E2-OBS-09 (Audit + metrics for governance) — wire OTel-backed policy observer, enrich policy spans, and ensure PII redaction in WAL audit path.
- Actions:
  - Implemented telemetry::policy_observer (OTel) with counter "policy.decision.count" and attributes {phase, kind, action}
  - Recorded decision_kind and rule_name on agent.policy.check spans in orchestrator; added PII redaction helper for audit.reason
  - Fixed tests: separate engines to avoid precedence interaction in RED test; YAML quoting bug in audit reason
  - Ran validations: cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture
- Results:
  - All tests PASS (workspace + doctests); clippy/fmt PASS
  - New files: crates/telemetry/src/policy_observer.rs; README note in crates/policy/README.md about OTel integration
- Diagnostics:
  - Naive rule matching means deny ToolInvocation matches unconditionally; use separate engines in tests to avoid Deny dominating Allow-by-flag
  - Avoid initializing OTLP pipeline implicitly in tests (requires tokio runtime); rely on global no-op meter when exporter not configured
- Decision(s): Proceed to REFACTOR (docs polish, attribute names settled: decision_kind, rule_name); keep observer optional and fail-closed by default.
- Follow-ups:
  - Update PR #78 body with AC mapping and validation evidence; mark Ready for Review
  - If approved, squash-merge, close Issue #77, clean branch, sync main, re-run validations, update TODO.md


- Area: Policy
- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E2-POL-05 (Governance baseline) by merging observability + audit hooks with deterministic ordering and deny-on-error posture; finalize docs and close out the task.
- Actions:
  - Squash-merged PR #76 to main (commit 86ab6badf6e9d6a65375b6d818b7015d2581f87b)
  - Deleted branch feat/governance-baseline (remote+local), synced main
  - Added crates/policy/README.md with PolicyObserver/policy_metrics examples
  - Expanded rustdoc for PolicyObserver, set_observer, PolicyMetrics/policy_metrics, AuditSink/install_audit_sink
  - Validations on main: cargo test/clippy/fmt
- Results:
  - Tests: PASS (workspace, all-features; doc-tests included)
  - Clippy: PASS (-D warnings)
  - Fmt: PASS
  - Merge SHA: 86ab6badf6e9d6a65375b6d818b7015d2581f87b
- Diagnostics:
  - Acceptance criteria satisfied: deterministic precedence (priority → most-restrictive → first-match), deny-on-error, low-cardinality metrics policy.decision.count{phase,kind,action} (alias flag for allow_but_flag), per-decision audit records
- Decision(s): Task closed; governance baseline in place with observability and audit. Proceed to next NOT_STARTED task per Docs/TODO.md.
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider dashboards for policy metrics; integrate with broader observability (E2-OBS-09)
  - Evaluate adapter parity tasks dependent on governance baseline

  Area: Policy
  Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E2-POL-05 governance baseline — add observability hooks and audit sink; make RED tests pass.
  Actions:
  - Implemented PolicyObserver + set_observer(), policy_metrics() counters, and install_audit_sink() in crates/policy/src/lib.rs
  - Wired emissions in pre_start_run, pre_submit_task, post_submit_task; added minimal docs and clippy fix
  - Ran validations: cargo fmt/clippy/tests (policy crate and workspace)
  Results:
  - All policy tests PASS (including governance_baseline_red now GREEN)
  - Workspace tests PASS; clippy -D warnings PASS; fmt --check PASS
  Diagnostics:
  - Using OnceLock + Mutex for in-process metrics/audit is sufficient for determinism and low-cardinality counters
  Decisions:
  - Proceed to REFACTOR to enhance rustdoc and ensure full observability coverage per rules
  Follow-ups:
  - REFACTOR phase: polish docs, add examples, ensure CI gates; then mark PR #76 ready and request review

- Date (UTC): 2025-10-28 00:09
- Area: Policy|Tests|Docs|Git
- Context/Goal: Kick off T-6a-E2-POL-05 (Governance baseline) via TDD RED phase: add failing acceptance tests, open branch/issue/PR.
- Actions:
  - Created branch feat/governance-baseline from main
  - Added RED tests: crates/policy/tests/governance_baseline_red.rs covering precedence, deny-on-error, allowlist, observability (metrics), and audit events
  - Ran: cargo test -p policy -- --nocapture (expected RED compile errors)
  - Pushed branch; opened Issue #75 and Draft PR #76 (Refs #75)
- Results:
  - cargo test -p policy: FAIL as expected; missing APIs in policy crate reported by rustc
    - E0405: trait PolicyObserver not found; E0425: set_observer/policy_metrics/install_audit_sink not found
  - Branch: origin/feat/governance-baseline; Issue #75 open; PR #76 open (draft)
- Diagnostics:
  - Observability (metrics) and audit hooks are not yet exposed by policy; will be added in GREEN via minimal, fail-closed wiring and low-cardinality metrics (policy.decision.count)
- Decision(s): Proceed to GREEN phase to implement observer/metrics/audit wiring and satisfy tests while maintaining deterministic precedence and deny-on-error posture.
- Follow-ups:
  - Implement GREEN per AC; keep clippy -D warnings and coverage ≥90% for core policy logic; document precedence in rustdoc

- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E4-BS-07 (Streaming IO + memory bounds) and T-6a-E4-BS-08 (BS2 read bounds & robustness); merge and validate on main.
- Actions:
  - Squash-merged PR #74 to main (commit fd4fd37) with message: feat(blob_store): streaming IO + memory bounds + read robustness (T-6a-E4-BS-07, T-6a-E4-BS-08); body: Closes #73
  - Deleted remote/local branch feat/blob-store-streaming; synced main
  - Re-ran workspace validations on main: fmt, clippy (-D warnings), tests (all-features)
  - Updated Docs/TODO.md: marked BS-07 and BS-08 complete; referenced PR/commit
  - Issue #73: posted completion comment with merge link; ensured closed
- Results:
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check → PASS
  - cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings → PASS
  - cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture → PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Final acceptance met:
    - BS-07: deterministic digest parity; bounded memory (chunked 64 KiB working set); legacy read fallback; metrics intact; tests pass
    - BS-08: header-enforced chunk_size bounds; per-chunk clen guards; typed Integrity failures; robustness tests pass
- Decision(s): Proceed to next Phase 6a priority task per TODO.md; skip optional histogram metric for now as previously agreed.
- Follow-ups: Identify next NOT_STARTED task (priority order) and prepare RED plan.

- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 09:28
- Area: Storage|Security|Tests|Docs
- Context/Goal: T-6a-E4-BS-08 — BS2 read bounds & robustness (enforce header chunk_size; reject oversize chunk lengths; avoid unbounded allocations).
- Actions:
  - Added constants AEAD_TAG_SIZE=16 and MAX_CHUNK_SIZE=4MiB; validated header chunk_size (non-zero, <= MAX_CHUNK_SIZE).
  - Plumbed chunk_size into DecryptedCompressedReader and reject clen==0 or clen>chunk_size+tag before allocating/reading.
  - New tests: bs2_robustness.rs (header zero size; chunk len > bound). Added ignored manual GET memory harness.
  - README: documented read-path enforcement.
  - Telemetry: enabled opentelemetry-otlp reqwest-client feature so OTLP example runs by default.
- Results:
  - cargo fmt/clippy/tests: PASS. Blob store tests incl. new robustness tests pass; memory harness is ignored by default.
  - Example: cargo run --example blob_otlp --features otel → runs; prints endpoint note.
- Diagnostics:
  - Prior read path ignored header chunk_size and could allocate `clen` bytes unbounded by header; fixed by pre-read checks and MAX_CHUNK_SIZE cap.
- Decision(s):
  - Keep MAX_CHUNK_SIZE at 4MiB; can be revisited with benchmarks. Maintain fail-closed on violations.
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider adding histogram for op byte sizes (deferred).


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 09:11
- Area: Storage|Docs|Observability
- Context/Goal: T-6a-E4-BS-07 REFACTOR — document BS2 streaming format, memory bounds, determinism; README and rustdoc polish.
- Actions:
  - Expanded rustdoc in crates/blob_store/src/lib.rs (BS2 header/chunks, nonce scheme, legacy fallback, memory bounds). Added docs to HashingWriter/DecryptedCompressedReader and streaming APIs.
  - Added crates/blob_store/README.md with BS2 format, usage examples (put_reader/get_to_writer), perf/memory notes.
  - Ran fmt/clippy/tests; executed OTLP example.
- Results:
  - cargo fmt/clippy/tests: PASS (workspace, all-features). Doc-tests: PASS.
  - Example run: started but OTLP exporter reports missing HTTP client feature.
- Diagnostics:
  - opentelemetry-otlp requires a client feature (e.g., reqwest-client) in addition to http-proto; current features omit it.
- Decision(s):
  - Keep example as-is; request approval to add `reqwest-client` feature in telemetry crate to make example fully functional by default.
- Follow-ups:
  - Post review on PR #74, add client feature via `cargo add opentelemetry-otlp -F reqwest-client` (with approval) or as a small follow-up PR.


- Area: Storage|Performance|Observability
- Context/Goal: T-6a-E4-BS-07 GREEN — implement bounded-memory streaming put/get with OTel counters while preserving determinism and back-compat.
- Actions:
  - Implemented streaming pipeline in blob_store: put_reader(get digest while compressing to temp) → encrypt chunked with BS2 header → atomic rename; get_to_writer streams decrypt+zstd via read::Decoder.
  - Added DecryptedCompressedReader to incrementally decrypt [len_be][ct] chunks; HashingWriter computes plaintext digest while writing.
  - Preserved legacy read path for pre-BS2 blobs (magic/version probe); fail-closed on integrity/crypto/IO.
  - Wired observer().put_bytes(total_plain) and observer().get_bytes(count) to satisfy telemetry integration tests.
  - Validated locally: cargo fmt/clippy/tests (crate + workspace) all PASS.
- Results:
  - blob_store tests: PASS (including new streaming_red.rs); telemetry integration: PASS; workspace: PASS.
  - Memory bounded by CHUNK_SIZE (64 KiB) + small rings; no large buffers in control path.
- Diagnostics:
  - zstd write::Decoder has no finish(); switched to read::Decoder + io::copy into HashingWriter.
  - sha2 0.10 API requires explicit trait method calls; avoided name collision with local Digest type.
- Decision(s):
  - Keep deterministic nonce scheme and BS2 header format; maintain legacy fallback for read.
  - Count logical plaintext bytes on put even for idempotent writes to keep metrics monotonic.
- Follow-ups:
  - REFACTOR: polish docs and README with BS2 format and memory bounds; optional histogram metrics; open PR and run CI.


- Area: Observability|Storage|CI
- Context/Goal: Verify, convert PR #72 to Ready, merge (squash), and validate on main.
- Actions:
  - Ran: cargo fmt --all -- --check (found minor fmt); cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture (PASS).
  - Updated PR #72 title; converted Draft → Ready via PATCH draft:false (POST ready_for_review endpoint 404s in tool).
  - Squash-merged PR #72 with descriptive commit title/message.
  - Pulled main and re-ran full workspace tests (PASS).
- Results:
  - Main branch includes: OTel blob observer, RAII spans, OTLP init helper, example, tests.
  - All gates PASS on main.
- Diagnostics:
  - Local working copy missed `crates/telemetry/src/blob_observer.rs` post-merge despite being tracked; restored with `git restore`.
- Decision(s): Proceed to plan next task focused on Blob Store streaming/bounds (Issue #70).
- Follow-ups:
  - Close/resolve PR #71 if superseded by #72; ensure Issue #70 links updated.


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 05:10
- Area: Observability|Storage
- Context/Goal: Add minimal OTLP HTTP exporter init helper and an end-to-end example; move PR #72 toward review readiness.
- Actions:
  - telemetry[otel]: added `init_otlp_from_env()` (idempotent) initializing tracer+meter providers from env (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME`) with HTTP exporter.
  - Added example binary `crates/telemetry/examples/blob_otlp.rs` demonstrating init helper + observer registration + blob ops (put/get/cleanup) and brief flush wait.
  - Updated `crates/telemetry/README.md` with example run instructions and snippet.
  - Ran validation: cargo fmt --all; cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture (PASS).
  - Updated PR #72 body to document the new helper and example.
  - Attempted to mark PR #72 Ready for Review via API; endpoint returned 404 (tool limitation). PR remains Draft; manual click needed.
- Results:
  - All validations PASS; example builds under `--features otel`.
  - PR #72 description updated; status still Draft pending manual Ready-for-Review conversion.
- Diagnostics:
  - opentelemetry-otlp requires `WithExportConfig` trait in scope for `.with_endpoint(..)`; imported explicitly.
  - Example uses tokio (dev-dep) to satisfy `install_batch(runtime::Tokio)` exporters; short sleep allows flush.
- Decision(s): Provide minimal helper rather than subscriber layer hookup; keep feature-gated and fail-closed by default.
- Follow-ups:
  - Convert PR #72 to Ready for Review in GitHub UI.
  - Optional: add force-flush/shutdown hooks for metrics/traces where feasible.


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 03:37
- Area: Observability|Storage
- Context/Goal: Enhance Blob Store OTel integration with real RAII spans, an OTLP wiring example, and property tests to validate metric correctness across sizes.
- Actions:
  - Upgraded blob_store::BlobSpan to hold type-erased guard for RAII span exit without adding tracing dep to blob_store.
  - telemetry[otel]: enter real tracing spans in blob_observer::span() and wrap guard in BlobSpan.
  - Added low-cardinality metric attributes: op={put|get|cleanup}.
  - Added README with OTLP exporter example and observer registration snippet.
  - Added property tests (proptest) for metric deltas across sizes; kept counters low-cardinality.
  - Ran validation: fmt, clippy --all-features -D warnings, and tests workspace-wide.
- Results:
  - All checks passed locally. Property tests exercised sizes: 0, 1, 1KB, <=4KB, 1MB.
  - PR #72 updated with the new enhancements and validation evidence.
- Diagnostics:
  - tracing::EnteredSpan is !Send; adjusted BlobSpan guard erasure to not require Send.
  - Removed unused import; ensured metrics maintain low cardinality.
- Decision(s): Keep RAII via type-erased guard; spans are best-effort under `otel` feature only; retain fail-closed defaults when observer not set.
- Follow-ups:
  - Optional: expose span attributes (digest prefix length-limited) if needed; evaluate impact on cardinality.
  - Optional: benchmark blob IO overhead with metrics enabled vs disabled (<5% target as per perf budgets).

- Actions:
  - Synced main; created branch feat/blob-store-otel-integration
  - Merged feat/blob-store-improvements into branch to access BlobStoreObserver trait (PR #71)
  - Added telemetry::blob_observer (feature `otel`): counters blob.put.bytes, blob.get.bytes, blob.cleanup.count; best-effort spans
  - Added integration test (feature `otel`) registering observer and exercising put/get/cleanup
  - Ran validations: cargo fmt; cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -D warnings; cargo test (crate + workspace, all-features)
  - Opened Draft PR #72
- Results:
  - cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo test -p telemetry --all-features -- --nocapture: PASS (1 test)
  - cargo test -p blob_store --all-features -- --nocapture: PASS (8 tests)
  - cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture: PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Initial unresolved imports due to trait not on main; resolved by merging improvements branch
  - Metrics are low-cardinality; instruments initialized via OnceCell; integration is optional and fail-closed
- Decision(s): Proceed with Draft PR #72; keep exporter setup external to crate; maintain feature-gated design
- Follow-ups:
  - Provide example wiring with OTLP exporter in README; consider property tests with test meter provider


- Area: Runtime|Storage|Observability
- Context/Goal: Implement follow-ups from staff review for Blob Store MVP (T-6a-E4-BS-06): edge-case tests, observability hooks, Windows rename handling; open PR.
- Actions:
  - Created branch feat/blob-store-improvements from synced main
  - Added tests: empty blob round-trip; explicit NotFound
  - Added pluggable observability hooks (put/get bytes; cleanup count) + optional spans; default no-op
  - Handled Windows rename race by treating AlreadyExists as success if final exists
  - Updated docs: duplicate-revealing deterministic nonces; key rotation considerations
  - Ran validations: cargo fmt, clippy (deny warnings), crate+workspace tests
  - Opened draft PR #71; created Issue #70 to track follow-ups
- Results:
  - cargo clippy -p blob_store -- -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo test -p blob_store -- --nocapture: PASS (8 tests)
  - cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture: PASS
  - Pushed branch and opened draft PR #71 referencing Issue #70
- Diagnostics:
  - No functional changes to on-disk format; observability is optional and disabled by default (no-op)
  - Tests confirm empty-blob identity/determinism and NotFound behavior
- Decision(s): Proceed with PR #71 as Draft; keep OTel wiring in a subsequent change to minimize risk
- Follow-ups:
  - Wire hooks to telemetry crate (`otel` feature): counters blob.put.bytes, blob.get.bytes, blob.cleanup.count; add spans
  - Property tests across sizes; bound decompression allocations; streaming IO for large blobs


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 02:18

- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E4-BS-06 (Blob Store MVP) by squash-merging PR #69, closing Issue #6, cleaning up branches, syncing main, and validating post-merge.
- Actions:
  - Converted PR #69 Ready for Review; updated PR body with RED→GREEN→REFACTOR completion and validation logs
  - Squash-merged PR #69 → main
  - Closed Issue #6 with link to merged PR
  - Deleted feature branch `feat/blob-store-mvp` (remote+local); synced local `main` (fast-forward)
  - Ran `cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture` on main
- Results:
  - Merge commit: f673ea4aa33fcfc7395922acddd887265fd48e3e (main)
  - Workspace tests: PASS; doctests: PASS
  - CI coverage job succeeded (threshold gates passed)
- Diagnostics:
  - Deterministic nonce = SHA-256(key||digest)[..12] enables dedup determinism; integrity verified via AEAD tag + plaintext digest check
  - Note: Windows rename semantics may require handling AlreadyExists on concurrent put() of same digest
- Decision(s): Accept Blob Store MVP for main; proceed to follow-ups focused on observability and robustness
- Follow-ups:
  - Add low-cardinality metrics/logs (blob.put.bytes, blob.get.bytes, cleanup.count)
  - Property tests (idempotence/determinism across sizes; empty blob; NotFound path)
  - Streaming IO for large blobs; bound decompression allocations
  - Handle cross-platform rename race (treat EEXIST as success); consider zeroize/KMS-backed KeyProvider

- Area: Runtime|Storage|Docs
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase for T-6a-E4-BS-06 — add comprehensive rustdoc, clean warnings, and validate workspace gates.
- Actions:
  - Wrote module-level docs (security model, determinism, atomicity), per-item rustdoc, and usage example doctest
  - Removed unused imports in tests; enabled `#![warn(missing_docs)]`
  - Ran `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -p blob_store -D warnings`, `cargo test -p blob_store`, and `cargo test --workspace`
- Results:
  - All crate and workspace tests PASS; doctest PASS; clippy PASS; fmt clean
- Diagnostics:
  - Current design intentionally uses deterministic nonces (SHA256(key||digest)[..12]) to meet dedup/determinism goals; integrity verified with AEAD tag and digest
- Decision(s):
  - Keep WARN on missing_docs (public items covered); consider DENY in follow-up once broader workspace is aligned
- Follow-ups:
  - Add low-cardinality metrics/logs in subsequent change; consider property tests for larger ranges and streaming IO


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-27 01:29
- Area: Runtime|Storage|Crypto
- Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E4-BS-06 — implement CAS + zstd + AES-256-GCM to satisfy RED tests deterministically and fail-closed.
- Actions:
  - Implemented BlobStore::put (digest→compress→encrypt→atomic rename, dir fsync)
  - Implemented BlobStore::get (read→decrypt→decompress→digest verify)
  - Implemented cleanup_incomplete() to remove *.incomplete artifacts
  - Added deterministic nonce derivation from key+digest via SHA-256(first 12 bytes)
  - Ran clippy (deny warnings) and tests for crate
- Results:
  - cargo clippy -p blob_store -- -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo test -p blob_store -- --nocapture: 6 passed, 0 failed
- Diagnostics:
  - Decrypt failures mapped to Integrity to satisfy wrong-key and tamper tests
  - Local #[allow(deprecated)] applied around Key/Nonce::from_slice due to upstream generic-array deprecation; avoids changing deps in this step
- Decision(s):
  - Keep deterministic nonce derivation (SHA-256(key||digest)[..12]) to ensure uniqueness per key and content
  - Maintain fixed zstd level (3); consider stream-based IO in follow-up for large blobs
- Follow-ups:
  - REFACTOR phase: rustdoc for public API, low-cardinality metrics, structured logs; property tests for idempotence and determinism; revisit deps to remove deprecated API usage when safe


- Area: Runtime
- Context/Goal: Kick off T-6a-E4-BS-06 — Blob Store MVP (CAS + zstd + encryption-at-rest) with TDD (RED phase) to establish deterministic, fail-closed artifact storage foundation.
- Actions:
  - Created feature branch feat/blob-store-mvp from main
  - Added new crate crates/blob_store and registered it in workspace Cargo.toml
  - Drafted RED tests covering: CAS digest identity, idempotent put, round-trip integrity, wrong-key failure, tamper detection, partial-write detection, deterministic behavior across runs
  - Ran targeted tests: cargo test -p blob_store -- --nocapture (expected failures)
- Results:
  - 6 failing tests as expected (RED); compile warnings noted (unused imports in tests, key field unused pending GREEN)
  - Validated acceptance coverage and deterministic test data generation
- Diagnostics:
  - Identity digest computed on plaintext; encryption-at-rest will derive deterministic nonce from digest to preserve determinism while ensuring unique nonces per key
  - Atomic write plan: temp file + fsync + atomic rename; directory fsync at sharded path
- Decision(s):
  - Use AES-256-GCM with 32-byte key via KeyProvider trait; fixed zstd level (3) for deterministic compression at rest
  - Sharded path layout sha256/aa/bb/<digest>; read-only rollback mode planned
- Follow-ups:
  - Implement GREEN phase: streaming write path (compress→encrypt), read/decrypt/verify, idempotent put, partial-write cleanup, error taxonomy
  - Add low-cardinality metrics (blob.put.bytes, blob.get.bytes) and structured logs in REFACTOR

- Area: Policy
- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E2-POL-05 (Governance baseline) with fail-closed deny-on-error semantics, deterministic precedence, and documentation; finalize RED→GREEN→REFACTOR.
- Actions:
  - RED: added 10 baseline tests in crates/policy/tests/baseline.rs (deny-on-error, taxonomy, precedence, determinism)
  - GREEN: implemented policy_loaded flag + fail-closed check after builtin PII redaction; preserved tool allowlist and precedence
  - REFACTOR: comprehensive rustdoc (module + public items), enabled #![warn(missing_docs)], added method docs incl. evaluation order
  - Validations run: cargo test -p policy -- --nocapture; cargo clippy -p policy -- -D warnings; cargo fmt --all -- --check; cargo doc -p policy --no-deps
- Results:
  - Tests: PASS (21/21 across baseline/priority/redaction/validation suites)
  - Clippy: PASS (no warnings)
  - rustfmt: PASS (after applying fmt)
  - Docs: PASS (cargo doc builds clean)
  - Behavior: deny when no valid policy loaded; PII redaction remains first; deterministic precedence intact
- Diagnostics:
  - Ordering confirmed: PII redaction → fail-closed check → allowlist → rules (priority → most-restrictive → first-match)
  - Addressed clippy::empty-line-after-doc-comments by removing blank lines after doc comments
- Decision(s): Adopt fail-closed baseline for policy engine; enforce documentation via missing_docs; keep existing taxonomy and precedence unchanged
- Follow-ups:
  1) Optional: expose Engine::is_policy_loaded() for observability/tests
  2) Add metrics counters for decisions (policy.decision.count{allow,deny,modify}) in a future observability pass
  3) Author admin docs for YAML schema and precedence examples

- Area: Security|Docs|CI
- Context/Goal: Merge PR #63 (T-6a-E3-SEC-04 Plugin manifest verification) to main; complete hardening; close Issue #4; post-merge validation and documentation updates.
- Actions:
  - Labeled PR (#63): enhancement, security, observability; appended validation evidence and code excerpts
  - Verified CI checks: build-test (ubuntu, macOS), coverage, otel-and-replay smoke — all SUCCESS
  - Squash-merged PR #63 → main (merge SHA 24b8cc5); remote+local branch deleted
  - Updated Docs/TODO.md to mark T-6a-E3-SEC-04 complete; ran local validations on main (fmt/clippy/tests)
- Results:
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check: PASS; cargo clippy --workspace -D warnings: PASS; cargo test --workspace --all-features: PASS
  - Issue #4 auto-closed via "Closes #4"; PR open → merged; main synchronized locally
- Diagnostics:
  - No regressions observed; test matrix stable; observability features remain gated and neutral by default
- Decision(s):
  - Squash-merge maintained; metrics feature name kept as `otel`; defer Sigstore bundle verification to follow-up
- Follow-ups:
  - Integrate real Sigstore bundle verification with golden fixtures; author signing runbook and trust root pinning guidance


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-26 04:45
- Area: Security|Observability|Tests
- Context/Goal: Harden plugin manifest verification (T-6a-E3-SEC-04) with strict input validation, timing-safe digest compare, and minimal OTel metrics behind a feature flag before opening PR.
- Actions:
  - Added error variants: InvalidDigestFormat, OversizedSignature; documented stable error_code strings
  - Refactored verify(): normalize+validate digest (64 hex), signature size cap (16 KiB), constant-time digest compare via subtle::ConstantTimeEq
  - Added feature-gated metrics (otel): Counter plugin.verify.failures{error_code}, Histogram plugin.verify.ms (OnceLock instruments)
  - Property tests: invalid_hex_rejected, oversized_signature_rejected; adjusted RED test to use valid-length wrong digest
  - Cargo: added subtle = "2"; added optional opentelemetry with feature alias otel → telemetry/otel + dep
- Results:
  - cargo fmt --all --check: PASS
  - cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture: PASS (plugin_host: 5 unit + 7 prop + 4 RED; 1 golden ignored)
- Diagnostics:
  - Early reject malformed digest improves determinism and prevents masking of format errors as mismatches
  - Size cap prevents potential DoS on signature decode path; metrics are no-op unless feature enabled
- Decision(s):
  - Signature cap set to 16 KiB; timing-safe compare added via subtle; feature name otel for metrics enablement
- Follow-ups:
  - Integrate real Sigstore bundle verification (offline) and add golden fixtures
  - Author signing runbook and trust root pinning guidance


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-26 03:21
- Area: Runtime|Security|Tests|Observability
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase for T-6a-E3-SEC-04 — add tracing spans, property tests, and golden fixtures for plugin manifest verification; ensure all quality gates pass.
- Actions:
  - Instrumented ManifestVerifier::verify() with span `agent.plugin.verify` and attributes {result, error_code}; no control-path changes
  - Added property tests (proptest) for digest normalization/case-folding, whitespace trimming, required-signature/SBOM errors, and base64 signature validation
  - Added golden fixture scaffolding under crates/plugin_host/tests/golden/sigstore; created ignored test with explicit reason pending real bundles
  - Resolved clippy issues: items_after_statements; needless_borrows_for_generic_args; added #![allow(missing_docs)] to test crates; provided #[ignore = "..."] reason
  - Validations: cargo fmt --all -- --check; cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings; cargo test --workspace --all-features -- --nocapture (all PASS)
- Results:
  - plugin_host: unit + property tests PASS; sigstore golden test ignored with reason; tracing compiles and is neutral without subscriber
  - Workspace: fmt/clippy/tests all PASS; no new warnings; deterministic behavior preserved
- Diagnostics:
  - Clippy flagged missing-docs for test crates and ignore_without_reason; fixed via crate-level allow and explicit ignore reason
  - Observability added without altering outcomes; spans are attributes-only
- Decision(s):
  - Keep signature verification fail-closed until real offline Sigstore bundles are integrated; metrics wiring via telemetry to be added behind feature flag in a follow-up
- Follow-ups:
  1) Integrate cosign-style Sigstore bundles (offline) and wire verification using `sigstore`
  2) Add OTel metrics via telemetry (feature-gated), plus span-to-metric mapping
  3) Draft signing runbook and add golden fixtures with pinned trust roots


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 22:09
- Area: Runtime|Security|Tests|Docs
- Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E3-SEC-04 — implement offline plugin manifest verification (digest pinning, policy gates) in plugin_host and confirm workspace validations.
- Actions:
  - Added dependencies: sha2, hex, base64, sigstore (offline only; no network)
  - Implemented ManifestVerifier::verify(): require signature + SBOM when policy enabled; compute sha256(WASM) and compare to manifest.wasm_digest (hex, case-insensitive); base64 signature material sanity check; fail-closed on signature verification pending fixtures
  - Updated tests: compute correct digest in invalid_signature_fails_verification to isolate signature path; kept other RED tests intact
  - Rustdoc and clippy clean-ups (missing-errors-doc, doc-markdown, items-after-statements)
  - Ran local validations: cargo fmt --all -- --check; cargo clippy --workspace -D warnings; cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture (all PASS)
- Results:
  - plugin_host: 4/4 tests PASS (manifest verification RED suite now GREEN); unit + integration tests stable
  - Workspace: all crates build and tests pass; clippy/fmt clean
  - Commit: 612480c (branch: feat/plugin-manifest-verification)
- Diagnostics:
  - Initial failure due to incorrect digest in test fixture; computing digest from WAT → WASM fixed the expectation so signature path is exercised
  - Signature verification remains fail-closed (InvalidSignature) until we introduce offline Sigstore bundle fixtures
- Decision(s):
  - Proceed to REFACTOR: add observability (plugin.verify.ms, plugin.verify.failures), property tests for digest parsing/case-folding, and golden fixtures for sigstore bundles; wire actual offline verification against a pinned trust root
- Follow-ups:
  1) Implement offline Sigstore verification using cosign-style bundle (no network); add test fixtures
  2) Add metrics/traces and structured errors; document signing runbook
  3) Update Issue #4 with GREEN completion and begin REFACTOR subsections


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 08:34
- Area: Runtime|Build|CI|Docs
- Context/Goal: Complete T-6a-E3-PH-03 (Wasmtime runner + hostcalls) by fixing CI, merging PR #62, closing Issue #3, cleaning up branches, syncing main, and recording outcomes.
- Actions:
  - Fixed CI duplicate artifact upload by gating upload step to ubuntu-latest in .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - Monitored CI to green for commit 033188c; all 4 jobs succeeded (ubuntu/macos build-test, otel-and-replay, coverage)
  - Squash-merged PR #62 with title: refactor(plugin-host): enforce fuel/timeout budgets + feature-gated hostcalls (T-6a-E3-PH-03) (#62)
  - Closed Issue #3 with validation evidence and merge link; deleted feature branch local+remote; synced main
  - Ran local validations on main: cargo fmt/clippy/tests all PASS
  - Updated Docs/TODO.md to mark T-6a-E3-PH-03 complete
- Results:
  - CI: success across matrix; merge commit: 52746640b604b8abe17944dfdfc8ad825ea5add7
  - Local: fmt PASS; clippy PASS; tests PASS (workspace)
- Diagnostics:
  - Root cause of earlier CI failure: duplicate artifact name across matrix jobs; resolved via conditional step
- Decision(s): Keep single-source artifact upload (ubuntu) to avoid conflicts; proceed to next task SEC-04 via TDD
- Follow-ups:
  1) Start T-6a-E3-SEC-04 on new branch from main (feat/plugin-manifest-verification)
  2) RED: failing tests for unsigned/tampered/invalid-sig/missing-SBOM
  3) GREEN: offline cosign verification, digest pinning, policy gate (fail-closed)
  4) REFACTOR: observability, docs, fixtures; open PR with evidence

# Development Log
- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 08:05
- Area: Build|CI|Orchestrator
- Context/Goal: Unblock PR #62 (T-6a-E3-PH-03) by fixing CI failures on macOS+Linux where `protoc` is not preinstalled.
- Actions:
  - Added build-dependency `protoc-bin-vendored = "3"` to `crates/orchestrator/Cargo.toml`
  - Updated `crates/orchestrator/build.rs` to set `PROTOC` to the vendored binary when not provided by env
  - Ran local validations (fmt/clippy/tests) and pushed fix to `feat/wasmtime-runner-hostcalls`
- Results:
  - Local: cargo fmt/check PASS; cargo clippy --workspace -D warnings PASS; cargo test --workspace PASS
  - CI: new workflow run started for commit 91e9f08; monitoring until green, then proceed to squash-merge
- Diagnostics:
  - GitHub Actions runners lacked `protoc`; `prost-build` panicked in build.rs; vendoring ensures reproducible builds across OS matrix
- Decision(s): Use vendored `protoc` to avoid OS package installs in CI; keep proto schema unchanged
- Follow-ups:
  1) Merge PR #62 on green; record merge SHA
  2) Close Issue #3 with completion comment and validation evidence
  3) Branch cleanup, sync main, mark TODO complete, append final merge dev-log entry
  4) Kick off T-6a-E3-SEC-04 on a new branch with TDD


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 06:57
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase (Part 2) for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — enforce CPU/time budgets (fuel + epoch timeout) and add minimal hostcall registry behind a feature flag; keep tests/clippy/fmt green.
- Actions:
  - Enabled fuel and epoch interruption on Engine; set per-invoke fuel via Store::set_fuel and timeout via epoch deadline + background increment
  - Added PluginRunner fields: fuel_budget (default 1_000_000) and timeout_ms (default 500ms); new with_limits_and_budgets(...)
  - Enriched invoke errors with suffix: "(fuel exhausted)" vs "(timeout/epoch interruption)" based on Store::get_fuel() after failure
  - Wired WASI (preview1) with deny-by-default posture; kept optional hostcalls behind `hostcalls` feature; implemented `env::host_log(ptr,len) -> i32`
  - Tests: added fuel_exhaustion_returns_error, timeout_exceeded_returns_error, hostcall_invalid_bounds_returns_error; integration test hostcall_log_integration (feature-gated)
  - Fixed string literal quoting in WAT fixtures; moved misplaced tests into #[cfg(test)] module
- Results:
  - cargo test -p plugin_host: PASS (default and with --features hostcalls)
  - cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check: PASS
  - cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture: PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Wasmtime v24 API uses Store::{set_fuel,get_fuel} (not add_fuel)
  - Timeout via epoch requires set_epoch_deadline + Engine::increment_epoch(); message is generic, so we annotate reason based on remaining fuel
  - Memory cap unit test returns -1 on memory.grow as expected under StoreLimits
- Decision(s):
  - Keep hostcalls behind `hostcalls` feature and minimal (single host_log) to limit surface area; no ambient authority
  - Defaults are fail-closed and bounded: 128 MiB, 1M fuel, 500 ms timeout
  - Observability (metrics/traces) and richer hostcall registry deferred to next polish
- Follow-ups:
  1) Open PR: refactor(plugin-host): fuel/timeout budgets + feature-gated hostcalls (T-6a-E3-PH-03)
  2) Update Issue #3 with REFACTOR Part 2 completion (summary + validation logs)
  3) If approved, squash-merge and proceed to observability polish in a follow-up


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 06:45
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — wire WASI sandbox with deny-by-default posture, enforce resource limits, keep tests/clippy/fmt green, and document.
- Actions:
  - Aligned deps to wasmtime/wasmtime-wasi v24.0.4; added pollster for blocking async paths
  - Switched Store state to preview1 WasiP1Ctx; added WASI via preview1::wasi_snapshot_preview1::add_to_linker
  - Enabled async support on Engine; used instantiate_async and call_async with pollster::block_on
  - Added StoreLimits memory cap (default 128 MiB) and unit test asserting memory.grow denial (-1)
  - Updated rustdoc with security posture and limits; kept observability as TODOs
- Results:
  - cargo test --workspace: PASS (all)
  - cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check: PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Wasmtime v24 uses async WASI shims; requires Engine Config async_support(true) and async instantiate/call
  - Type for preview1 add_to_linker expects WasiP1Ctx; use WasiCtxBuilder::build_p1()
  - StoreLimits caps effective for memory.grow returning -1 (no trap)
- Decision(s):
  - Defer hostcall registry (host_log) to follow-up to keep scope <50 LoC; document as TODO in Issue #3
  - Fuel/timeouts will be implemented in next polish pass (configurable limits, fail-closed)
- Follow-ups:
  1) Add fuel budget + timeout (epoch/fuel) with tests
  2) Minimal hostcall registry (host_log) behind feature flag
  3) Observability (metrics/traces) for invoke + limits; docs for plugin authoring

- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 05:58
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — implement minimal Wasmtime-backed runner to load a module and invoke an exported function.
- Actions:
  - Replaced stubs with Engine/Module/Store/Linker implementation
  - Added unit test for missing export error path; kept integration test invoking add(2,3)
- Results: Validations PASS — cargo test -p plugin_host, cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings, cargo fmt -- --check, cargo test --workspace
- Diagnostics: Kept GREEN minimal; WASI wiring deferred to REFACTOR to preserve scope and deny-by-default posture
- Decision(s): Proceed to REFACTOR to add WASI sandbox and resource limits while maintaining security baseline
- Follow-ups: REFACTOR — WASI ctx + add_to_linker, per-invoke fuel, memory cap placeholder, observability TODOs


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 04:58
- Area: Orchestrator|Performance|Docs|CI|Git
- Context/Goal: Add targeted micro-benchmark for VirtualClock::now_ms() to verify ≤200 ns p95 budget (T-6a-E1-ORCH-02), then execute standard end-of-task workflow (merge PR #61, close Issue #2, branch cleanup, sync main).
- Actions:
  - Created `crates/orchestrator/benches/clock.rs` (Criterion) and added `[[bench]] name = "clock", harness = false` to orchestrator Cargo.toml
  - Ran `cargo bench --bench clock` and captured results; updated PR #61 body and Issue #2 with summary
  - Squash-merged PR #61 into main (merge commit: 520f63b); closed Issue #2; deleted branch `feat/virtual-time-clock`
  - Synced main locally; ran validations and formatted benches per rustfmt (commit: 43ca241)
  - Validations: `cargo bench --bench clock` (PASS); `cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture` (PASS); `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` (PASS); `cargo fmt -- --check` (PASS)
- Results:
  - Benchmark (group: clock_now_ms):
    - virtual_clock_now_ms: median ~4.24 ns; p95 ≪ 200 ns
    - system_clock_now_ms: median ~19.53 ns
    - direct_systemtime_now: median ~19.53 ns
  - Baseline artifacts written under `target/criterion/` for future perf regression checks
  - All AC for ORCH-02 satisfied; main is green post-merge
- Diagnostics:
  - Criterion sample_size set to 1000 for better resolution on sub-20ns paths
  - Process-wide registry read path shows negligible overhead; VirtualClock has no syscalls/allocations
- Decision(s):
  - Accept VirtualClock performance; record baseline and proceed
  - Plan follow-up lint to deny direct SystemTime/Instant in orchestrator
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider explicit `with_clock(...)` constructor for orchestrator in integration tests
  - Add CI perf guard using Criterion baselines when noise thresholds are established


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 03:49
- Area: Orchestrator|Determinism|Docs|CI
- Context/Goal: Implement T-6a-E1-ORCH-02 Virtual Time service (Clock trait + Virtual/System clocks) with injection into orchestrator; validate workspace and open PR.
- Actions:
  - Added crates/orchestrator/src/clock.rs with Clock trait, SystemClock, VirtualClock, process_clock()/set_process_clock(), unit tests, and doctest
  - Replaced all orchestrator control-path `now_ms()` uses with `clock::process_clock().now_ms()`; added rustdoc and examples
  - Ran formatting and lints across workspace; fixed replay-cli clippy warnings (option-as-ref-deref, too_many_arguments)
  - Validation: cargo fmt -- --check (PASS); cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings (PASS); cargo test --workspace (PASS); cargo test -p orchestrator --doc (PASS)
  - Opened PR #61 to main with AC mapping and validation results; updated Issue #2
- Results: Deterministic time abstraction in place; all workspace checks green; PR #61 open
- Diagnostics: Doctest import path needed external crate form (`orchestrator::clock::...`)
- Decision(s): Proceed with review; maintain process-wide registry for simplicity; consider explicit DI helper as follow-up
- Follow-ups: On approval, squash-merge PR #61, close Issue #2, delete branch, sync main, append final dev log entry


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:49
- Area: Workflow|Git|Docs
- Context/Goal: Complete merge workflow for T-6a-E1-EL-01 and establish standard end-of-task process for ORCA.
- Actions:
  - Updated code comments in event-log v2 module to reflect completion status (deterministic serialization; golden-tested)
  - Squash-merged PR #60 to main (commit: 1607090de62492abecdb444dfc82f77a481a0a97)
  - Closed Issue #1 with final summary and commit link
  - Deleted feature branch feat/wal-v2-schema (remote and local)
  - Synced local main and validated: cargo test --workspace (PASS)
  - Created new feature branch feat/virtual-time-clock for T-6a-E1-ORCH-02
- Results: Clean merge to main; repo and branches tidy; all tests green on main
- Decision(s): Adopt the following standard end-of-task workflow for all tasks:
  1) Pre-merge quality check: update stale code comments (RED/skeleton/stub → final)
  2) Push and PR: comprehensive description referencing issue and AC
  3) Merge: prefer squash for single-feature branches after validations pass
  4) Close issue: comment with commit link and verification notes, then close
  5) Branch cleanup: delete remote+local feature branch
  6) Sync: pull main locally and re-run validation
  7) Next branch: create from updated main for the next task
  8) Document: append dev log entry with timestamps, actions, results, decisions
- Follow-ups: Apply this workflow consistently for subsequent tasks (next: T-6a-E1-ORCH-02)


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:37
- Area: WAL|Docs|CI
- Context/Goal: Push feature branch and open PR for T-6a-E1-EL-01 (WAL v2 schemas + golden tests), update tracking, and prepare next task.
- Actions:
  - Pushed branch `feat/wal-v2-schema` to origin
  - Opened PR #60 to main: feat(event-log): WAL v2 schemas + golden tests (T-6a-E1-EL-01)
  - Updated Issue #1 with PR link and status (awaiting review)
  - Ran workspace validation: cargo test --workspace (PASS)
  - Maintained scope to event-log + Docs; TODO.md marked complete for this task
- Results: Remote branch created; PR open (https://github.com/ziXnOrg/ORCA/pull/60); tests/clippy pass; fmt note limited to other crates (unchanged here)
- Diagnostics: None new; formatting diffs in other crates pre-exist and are out-of-scope for this PR
- Decision(s): Keep Issue #1 open until merge and verification on main
- Follow-ups:
  - On approval: merge PR; verify on main; then close Issue #1
  - Next task candidate per Quick Start: T-6a-E1-ORCH-02 (Virtual Time service)


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:15
- Area: WAL
- Context/Goal: Implement T-6a-E1-EL-01 (WAL v2 schemas + golden tests) with deterministic typed serialization and backward-compatibility.
- Actions:
  - Added event_log::v2 typed schema (RecordV2<T>, EventTypeV2, StartRunPayload, TaskEnqueuedPayload, UsageUpdatePayload)
  - Wrote golden fixture and tests: wal_v2_golden.rs (bytes match) and v1_v2_compat.rs (v2 readable via v1 EventRecord<Value>)
  - Finalized Docs/schemas/v2.md with normative field order and invariants
  - Ran validations: cargo test -p event-log, cargo clippy -p event-log; noted workspace fmt diffs to be handled separately
- Results: All event-log tests passing; clippy clean for event-log; golden file stable
- Diagnostics: Serde maps caused ordering mismatch; fixed via typed structs with struct field order
- Decision(s): Keep v2 writer separate; rely on v1 EventRecord to read v2 for now; full version-gating/virtual clock later
- Follow-ups:
  - Add additional variants (policy_audit, run_summary, budget_*) and property tests
  - Wire VirtualClock and wal_v2 feature flag in orchestrator (future tasks)

### 2025-10-24 08:39 (UTC)

#### Area
Docs|TODO|Validation|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Validate and improve structural integrity of Docs/TODO.md: deduplicate Quick Start vs Phase 6a, add explicit rule-file citations for traceability across all tasks, fill identified gaps with two new tasks, and open corresponding issues.

#### Actions
- Deduplicated Quick Start: replaced expanded tasks with references to Phase 6a (Docs/TODO.md lines 17–30)
- Added "Rules referenced:" bullets after every "Artifacts & Repro:" across sections (Phase 6a lines ~62, 86, 112, 138, 167, 195, 233, 256; Phase 6b lines ~294, 318, 345, 369, 393, 420, 444, 468, 495, 519, 543, 567, 592, 619, 644; Phase 7 & Global lines ~674, 700, 724, 750, 774, 800, 824, 850, 879, 906, 941, 968, 994, 1019, 1046, 1073, 1125, 1157, 1178, 1196, 1210, 1228, 1249, 1266, 1286, 1304, 1322)
- Added new tasks:
  - T-GB-OBS-SDK-49 (Global/Observability/SDK) with full 11-category structure (Docs/TODO.md lines ~1078–1105)
  - T-CR-REPLAY-02 (Code Review Batch 2) canonical JSON + goldens (Docs/TODO.md lines ~1261–1277)
- Opened GitHub issues: #58 (T-GB-OBS-SDK-49) [labels: global, observability, sdk, risk-low; milestone M12; Depends on #16] and #59 (T-CR-REPLAY-02) [labels: code-review, refactoring, risk-low, crate-replay_cli; milestone M12; Depends on #57]

#### Results
- TODO.md structural integrity improved; Quick Start is canonicalized via Phase 6a refs
- Traceability enhanced: every task now cites applicable `.augment/rules/*.md`
- Gaps filled with two actionable tasks; issues #58 and #59 created and triaged to M12

#### Diagnostics
- Prior duplication between Quick Start and Phase 6a caused ambiguous task ownership; canonicalizing Phase 6a reduces drift
- Rule citations enable auditability against safety-critical standards (determinism, security, perf, observability, testing)

#### Decision(s)
- Adopt "Rules referenced:" as required sub-item for all tasks going forward
- Treat Phase 6a as the single source for Quick Start content; Quick Start remains a navigational index only

#### Follow-ups
- Monitor for any missed rule citations during future task additions
- After implementation PRs begin, ensure new tasks continue to include rule references and acceptance/test gates

### 2025-10-24 08:05 (UTC)

#### Area
CodeReview|EventLog|Telemetry|Budget|ReplayCLI|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Batch 2 code review of 4 Rust production files; add CR tasks; open issues with labels/milestone/deps.

#### Files Reviewed (lines; responsibility)
- crates/event-log/src/lib.rs (126) — JSONL WAL (open/append/read_range)
- crates/telemetry/src/lib.rs (162) — logging + optional OTel; budget counters
- crates/budget/src/lib.rs (93) — budget manager, counters, thresholds
- crates/replay-cli/src/main.rs (249) — WAL replay/inspect/trace CLI

#### Strengths
- EventLog typed errors and doc-tests; Telemetry provides JSON logs baseline; Budget API clear and simple; Replay CLI has deterministic output test.

#### Issues (by severity)
- Critical: WAL lacks fsync checkpoints and ordering assertion; monotonicity not enforced by storage [agentic-architecture.mdc; code-standards.md]
- High: Telemetry: init lacks tracer/subscriber hookup; missing redaction and attribute allowlist [observability.md]
- Med: Budget: defaults are permissive (None => unlimited), conflicts with fail-closed posture; no telemetry export [security-privacy.md; rust-standards.md]
- Low: Replay CLI: no schema validation/redaction flags; potential leakage in stdout [security-privacy.md]

#### Decisions
- Create tasks in Docs/TODO.md under Code Review — Batch 2: T-CR-EL-01, T-CR-TEL-01, T-CR-BUD-01, T-CR-REPLAY-01.
- Open issues with M12 and dependencies (#11, #16 where applicable).

#### Issues Created
- #54 (T-CR-EL-01), #55 (T-CR-TEL-01), #56 (T-CR-BUD-01), #57 (T-CR-REPLAY-01)

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: proceed to Batch 3 if remaining files; or begin implementation of high-risk items first (WAL determinism).

### 2025-10-24 07:55 (UTC)

#### Area
CodeReview|Issues

#### Actions
- Created GitHub issues for CR Batch 1 tasks: #49 (T-CR-ORCH-01), #50 (T-CR-ORCH-02), #51 (T-CR-ORCH-03), #52 (T-CR-ORCH-04), #53 (T-CR-POL-01)
- Applied labels per task (code-review, refactoring/tech-debt/security-fix + crate-* + risk-*); set milestone M12
- Added explicit Dependencies in issue bodies (#11, #32, #16 as applicable)

#### Results
- All 5 issues are open and visible; labels correct; milestone M12 assigned; dependency references clickable in GitHub UI

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: proceed to Code Review Batch 2 (next 4–6 files), and open issues for those findings

- crates/orca-core/src/lib.rs (225) — ids, envelope schema, metadata validation
- crates/policy/src/lib.rs (250) — policy engine (rules, redaction, allowlist)

#### Strengths
- Fail-closed patterns present in RBAC (unwrap_or(false)), budget enforcement, policy deny paths.
- WAL audit events for policy decisions; tracing spans cover key operations; budget metrics wired.
- mTLS configuration requiring client auth; serde-based schema validation in core metadata.

#### Issues (by severity)
- Critical: Event id generation resets after restart (NEXT_ID starts at 1); WAL ids may regress (violates determinism/replay invariants). [rust-standards.md §Determinism; agentic-architecture.mdc]
- High: Wall-clock time used on control paths (now_ms) without virtual clock; record/replay non‑deterministic. [agentic-architecture.mdc; testing-validation.mdc]
- High: Panics/unwraps on control paths (policy.reload, serde). Violates no-panics rule in library code. [rust-standards.md]
- Med: Auth header handling expects raw token; lacks Bearer parsing and constant-time compare. [security-privacy.md]
- Med: RPC envelope kind mapping uses Debug→lowercase ("agentresult"), not snake_case ("agent_result"). API correctness risk. [rust-standards.md]
- Low: Policy engine returns String errors; minimal observability; simplistic rule matching via contains(). [observability.md; testing-validation.md]

#### Decisions
- Create CR tasks T-CR-ORCH-01..04 and T-CR-POL-01 in Docs/TODO.md (11-category structure) with M12 alignment and dependencies on WAL v2/simulation where relevant.

#### Follow-ups
- Await approval to create GitHub issues for new CR tasks and to proceed with Batch 2 (next 4–6 files).

### 2025-10-23 15:05 (UTC)

#### Area
Policy|Validation|Precedence|Docs|Tests

#### Context/Goal
Phase 5 Task 2: Add rule priority/precedence, robust YAML validation, and author policy reload design. Maintain compatibility and fail-closed semantics.

#### Changes
- Policy Engine (`crates/policy/src/lib.rs`):
  - Added `priority: i32` to `Rule` (default 0 for backward compatibility).
  - Implemented priority-aware interpreter: evaluate all matches, choose highest `priority`; tie-break via most-restrictive-wins (Deny > Modify > Allow), then first-match for determinism.
  - Preserved ordering: built-in PII redaction → tool allowlist (deny-by-default) → rules.
  - Strengthened `load_from_yaml_path(...)` error handling with descriptive errors and validation:
    - Actions limited to `deny|modify|allow_but_flag`.
    - `tool_allowlist`: non-empty strings, case-folded, duplicates rejected.
    - Optional `transform: regex:<pattern>` validated (compile check).
- Tests (`crates/policy/tests/`):
  - `priority.rs`: three tests covering equal-priority restrictiveness, higher-priority allow over deny, and first-match tie.
  - `validation.rs`: six tests for empty file, invalid action, duplicate/empty allowlist entries, malformed regex transform, and missing fields.
- Docs:
  - Added `Docs/policy_reload_design.md` covering thread-safety, atomicity, error handling, admin API design, security, and testing strategy.

#### Results
- All workspace tests pass (`cargo test --workspace`).
- Policy precedence is deterministic and security-centric (fail-closed tie-breakers).
- YAML loading now rejects malformed/unsafe policies without crashing; previous valid policy persists on reload failures.

#### Follow-ups
- Consider expanding rule conditions beyond simple string contains to structured predicates in a future phase (out of scope for Phase 5).
- Integrate admin reload API (design complete; implementation deferred per scope).


### 2025-10-23 14:20 (UTC)


#### Area
Policy|Audit|Orchestrator|Tests|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Phase 5 Task 1: Define and integrate audit event schema; wire policy audit across orchestrator; ensure fail-closed model; prepare for tool allowlists and reload.

#### Actions
- Policy Engine (`crates/policy/src/lib.rs`):
  - Extended `Decision` with `rule_name` and `action` for traceability.
  - Added optional top-level `tool_allowlist` support; implemented deny-by-default enforcement when a tool name is present and not allowed.
  - Preserved PII redaction (regex) and attributed modifications to a rule name (`builtin_redact_pii` or explicit rule).
- Orchestrator (`crates/orchestrator/src/lib.rs`):
  - Made policy engine shared via `Arc<RwLock<...>>`; added `load_policy_from_path()` and env-based auto-reload hooks (`ORCA_POLICY_PATH`, `ORCA_POLICY_RELOAD_MS`).
  - Implemented `append_policy_audit(...)` to emit sanitized audit events with fields: `event`, `phase`, `run_id`, `workflow_id`, `envelope_id`, `agent`, `envelope_kind`, `trace_id`, `rule_name`, `action`, `reason`, `outcome`.
  - Wired audit emission at `pre_start_run`, `pre_submit_task`, and `post_submit_task` (only when there is an intervention: deny/modify/allow_but_flag).
  - Ensured audit payloads never include `payload_json` or other sensitive/PII fields.
- Tests:
  - Added integration-style tests inside orchestrator module verifying audit events for `deny` and `modify` decisions; ensured WAL contains `policy_audit` entries with correct outcomes.
- Docs:
  - Prefixed `Docs/policy.yaml` with a sample `tool_allowlist`.

#### Results
- Policy interventions are now auditable end-to-end via WAL with correlation fields and without leaking PII.
- Runtime policy reload path available; deny-by-default semantics preserved on errors or disallowed tools.

#### Follow-ups
- Task 2: Expand rule interpreter (ordering/precedence), finalize tool allowlist semantics across envelope kinds, and design/admin endpoint for safe runtime reload.
- Task 3: Broaden unit tests in `crates/policy/tests/` to reach ≥90% coverage and include negative/edge cases.


### 2025-10-21 09:01 (UTC)

#### Area
Policy|Audit|Testing|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Kick off Phase 5: implement policy.yaml loader, wire audit events, extend tests and docs.

#### Actions
- Added serde_yaml dep and loader for `Docs/policy.yaml` in `policy::Engine`, with a minimal rule matching mechanism.
- Extended policy engine struct and API to support on-disk policy config and runtime reload.
- Added audit event representation (structs, log points) for `deny`/`modify` matches (no sensitive content in audit fields).
- Created smoke test to parse policy.yaml and check rules are loaded + functional.
- Updated doc references to policy loader and audit log expectations.

#### Results
- Policy engine supports config-driven rule updates; audit hooks ready for Phase 5 extension (tool allowlists, fine-grained moderation).

#### Follow-ups
- Expand on audit log schema, document audit event handling, and add more comprehensive moderation/tool tests.
- Integrate policy reload/admin hook in orchestrator (future Phase 5 step).

### 2025-10-21 08:32 (UTC)

#### Area

#### Actions
- Added `crates/orchestrator/tests/span_coverage.rs` capturing span names; verified policy/budget/WAL spans present.
- Added `crates/policy/tests/redaction.rs` ensuring SSN-like PII is redacted.
- Created `Docs/debugging.md` (tracing, replay CLI, metrics) and linked in CI artifacts.
- Updated CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to build `orchestrator` with `--features otel` and build `replay-cli`.

#### Results
- Tests passed locally; CI updated to include optional otel/replay smoke.

#### Follow-ups
- Implement log redaction hooks end-to-end in spans/logs (Phase 5 tie-in).

### 2025-10-21 08:18 (UTC)

#### Area
WAL|Tests

#### Context/Goal
Add determinism-focused tests for replay CLI (filters, ordering, to-trace output).

#### Actions
- Added unit tests in `crates/replay-cli/src/main.rs` covering range semantics, timestamp filters, max truncation, and deterministic JSON output for `to-trace`.
- Fixed test expectation to reflect half-open `[start, end)` semantics of `read_range`.

#### Results
- All 3 tests passed locally.

#### Follow-ups
- Add E2E test invoking orchestrator to produce WAL then verify CLI outputs equivalence.

### 2025-10-21 08:11 (UTC)

#### Area
Observability|WAL|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Complete WAL Replay CLI with useful subcommands and filters for Phase 4.

#### Actions
- Implemented `inspect`, `replay`, and `to-trace` subcommands in `crates/replay-cli/src/main.rs`.
- Added filters: `--run-id`, `--from/--to`, `--since-ts-ms`, `--max`, `--dry-run`, `--interactive`.
- Built `replay-cli` binary successfully.

#### Results

### 2025-10-21 08:02 (UTC)

#### Area
Observability

#### Context/Goal
Harden metrics exporter: real OTLP pipeline, env-configurable, counters/histograms for budgets.

#### Actions
- Aligned OTel deps in `crates/telemetry/Cargo.toml`; enabled `rt-tokio` on SDK.
- Implemented OTLP metrics pipeline with `opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline().metrics(runtime::Tokio)`.
- Added counters/histograms: `orca.tokens.total`, `orca.cost.total_micros`, `orca.tokens.per_task`, `orca.cost.per_task_micros`.
- Rebuilt `telemetry` and `orchestrator` with `--features otel`.
- Updated docs `Docs/observability.jaeger.md` with metrics env vars and verification steps.

#### Results
- Build succeeded for telemetry/orchestrator with `otel` feature. Metrics ready for OTLP export.

#### Diagnostics
- Initial build failed due to version mismatches and API changes; fixed by removing `tracing-opentelemetry` for now and using runtime API for metrics.

#### Decisions
- Defer tracing layer hookup to avoid multiple `opentelemetry` versions; keep metrics export minimal and stable.

#### Follow-ups
- Re-introduce tracing subscriber layer once versions are unified and tested.
- Add integration test to assert metrics emission via mock collector.

### 2025-10-21 07:45 (UTC)

#### Area

- Updated `Docs/API/HOWTO.md` with budget usage and link to guide.
- Linked cost guide in `README.md`.

#### Results
- Users have a clear guide to configure budgets, interpret warnings/exceeded, and handle SDK errors.

### 2025-10-21 07:25 (UTC)

#### Area
Build|Tests|Runtime|Alignment

#### Context/Goal
Comprehensive alignment review: fix compilation errors, validate all tests, confirm Phases 0-3 + partial Phase 4 complete.

#### Actions
- Fixed Rust toolchain: upgraded to `stable` (supports icu deps).
- Fixed proto serde: enabled `Serialize`/`Deserialize` in `tonic_build`.
- Fixed orchestrator: added missing deps (`policy`, `budget`, `telemetry`, `serde_json`); made `index` public for tests; resolved borrow conflicts in policy/budget paths.
- Fixed event-log: added `Clone` derive to `JsonlEventLog`.
- Fixed integration tests: moved to `crates/orchestrator/tests/`; added `Orchestrator` trait import; fixed `spawn_server` tempdir lifetime; added `futures-util` dep.
- Fixed budget test: adjusted token limits to properly trigger exceeded state.
- Stubbed OTel metrics export (version conflict with `opentelemetry-otlp`; will refine in next iteration).

#### Results
- **Build**: ✅ `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` succeeds (warnings only).
- **Tests**: ✅ 14 tests pass across workspace:
  - `event-log`: 1 test (append roundtrip)
  - `orca-core`: 6 tests (IDs, envelope, metadata validation)
  - `orchestrator` lib: 2 tests (TTL rejection, idempotency)
  - `orchestrator` integration: 2 tests (happy path, TTL timeout)
  - `orchestrator` budget: 2 tests (warn/exceed, isolation)
  - `orchestrator` restart: 1 test (replay rebuilds index)
- **Phase 0**:  Complete (WAL, IDs, telemetry baseline, security stubs, CI, tooling)
- **Phase 1**:  Complete (orchestrator service, proto schema, contracts, TTL/retry, idempotency, WAL integration, tests)
- **Phase 2**:  Complete (SDK docs, metadata model, StreamEvents, recovery, mTLS/RBAC hooks, policy hooks)
- **Phase 3**:  Core complete (usage tracking, budgets, enforcement, metrics, tests); pending docs/SDK finalization
- **Phase 4**:  In progress (span coverage ✅, OTel export stub ✅, replay CLI ✅; pending Jaeger, log enrichment, debug guide)

#### Diagnostics
- Toolchain pinned to `stable` for forward compatibility.
- Proto-generated types now serde-compatible for policy/budget JSON workflows.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end gRPC flows, budget isolation, and crash recovery.
- OTel metrics export: stubbed due to `opentelemetry-otlp` 0.15 API mismatch with `opentelemetry_sdk` 0.22; will align versions in Phase 4 refinement.

#### Decision(s)
- **Toolchain**: Use `stable` channel for production readiness and ecosystem compatibility.
- **OTel metrics**: Stub for now; will wire OTLP exporter in Phase 4 final pass when deps align.
- **Integration tests**: Keep in `crates/orchestrator/tests/` for simplicity (workspace-level tests require separate crate).

#### Follow-ups
- [ ] Complete Phase 3: cost management guide, SDK budget examples finalization
- [ ] Complete Phase 4: Jaeger/Zipkin integration, log enrichment, debugging guide, redaction in traces
- [ ] Align OTel deps and wire real OTLP metrics export
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before next commit
- [ ] Update CI to run all integration tests

- Created `Docs/ADR/0001-transport.md` documenting gRPC/HTTP2 with tonic decision.
- Defined `Docs/API/orca_v1.proto` with Envelope, StartRun, SubmitTask, StreamEvents, FetchResult.
- Added `Docs/API/versioning.md` outlining major package versioning and envelope `protocol_version` evolution.

#### Results
- Transport layer decided; proto schema v1 in place; versioning policy documented.

#### Context/Goal
Phase 0 completion: pre-commit hooks, audit/deny, security/policy stubs, tests/bench, docs.

#### Actions
- Added `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (fmt, clippy, tests, gitleaks).
- Created `.github/workflows/audit-deny.yml` and `cargo-deny.toml`.
- Seeded `Docs/policy.yaml`, `event-log/benches/append.rs`, `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

#### Results
- Pre-commit hooks, audit/deny CI, and baseline docs in place. Phase 0 complete.

#### Context/Goal
Implement orchestrator stub with timeouts and WAL integration; baseline telemetry.

#### Actions
- Created `crates/orchestrator` with minimal state machine (timeouts).
- Created `crates/telemetry` with JSON logging and optional OTel init.
- Updated `orca-core/envelope` with `AgentTask`, `AgentResult`, `AgentError` structs.

#### Results
- Orchestrator stub and telemetry baseline operational. WAL integration verified.

#### Area
Runtime|WAL

#### Context/Goal
Implement minimal WAL (JSONL event log) with append and read_range operations.

#### Actions
- Created `crates/event-log` with `JsonlEventLog` struct.
- Implemented `append` (with fsync) and `read_range` for offset-based retrieval.

#### Results
- WAL prototype complete; supports ordered append and replay reads.

#### Area
Runtime|Core

#### Context/Goal
Implement ID utilities (monotonic, UUIDs, timestamps) and message envelope schema.

#### Actions
- Created `crates/orca-core/src/ids.rs` with `next_monotonic_id`, `now_ms`, `new_trace_id`.
- Added `crates/orca-core/src/envelope.rs` with `Envelope`, `AgentTask`, `AgentResult`, `AgentError`.

#### Results
- ID generation and message envelope schema operational. Deterministic ID scheme in place.

#### Area
Build|CI

#### Context/Goal
Set up Rust toolchain pinning and workspace scaffold; configure CI matrix (macOS/Linux).

#### Actions
- Created `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.75 stable), workspace `Cargo.toml` with release/bench profiles.
- Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (fmt, clippy -D warnings, tests) for macOS + Linux.

#### Results
- Toolchain pinned; workspace initialized; CI running fmt/clippy/tests on multi-OS.

#### Area
Docs|Architecture

#### Context/Goal
Update Roadmap to reflect Rust-first core decision (from initial Python assumption).

#### Actions
- Rewrote Roadmap Phase 0–2 sections: orchestrator core is Rust from start; Python/TS SDKs are gRPC clients.
- Updated execution steps, security, and SDK integration sections accordingly.

#### Results
- Roadmap aligned with Rust-first architecture; no conflicting language assumptions remain.

#### Area
Docs|Rules

#### Context/Goal
Establish Cursor rules for ORCA project; align Rust standards with rustZK best practices; define Python/TS standards.

#### Actions
- Created `.cursor/rules`: agentic-architecture, observability, testing-validation, security-privacy, performance-optimization, rust-standards, python-standards, typescript-standards, dev-log, multi-agent-coordination, roadmap-alignment.
- Created `clippy.toml` (pedantic, nursery) and `rustfmt.toml` (width 100, stable defaults).

#### Results
- Comprehensive rule set in place; linters configured; standards enforced from day one.
