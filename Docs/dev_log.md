# Development Log
- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 08:05
- Area: Build|CI|Orchestrator
- Context/Goal: Unblock PR #62 (T-6a-E3-PH-03) by fixing CI failures on macOS+Linux where `protoc` is not preinstalled.
- Actions:
  - Added build-dependency `protoc-bin-vendored = "3"` to `crates/orchestrator/Cargo.toml`
  - Updated `crates/orchestrator/build.rs` to set `PROTOC` to the vendored binary when not provided by env
  - Ran local validations (fmt/clippy/tests) and pushed fix to `feat/wasmtime-runner-hostcalls`
- Results:
  - Local: cargo fmt/check PASS; cargo clippy --workspace -D warnings PASS; cargo test --workspace PASS
  - CI: new workflow run started for commit 91e9f08; monitoring until green, then proceed to squash-merge
- Diagnostics:
  - GitHub Actions runners lacked `protoc`; `prost-build` panicked in build.rs; vendoring ensures reproducible builds across OS matrix
- Decision(s): Use vendored `protoc` to avoid OS package installs in CI; keep proto schema unchanged
- Follow-ups:
  1) Merge PR #62 on green; record merge SHA
  2) Close Issue #3 with completion comment and validation evidence
  3) Branch cleanup, sync main, mark TODO complete, append final merge dev-log entry
  4) Kick off T-6a-E3-SEC-04 on a new branch with TDD


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 06:57
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase (Part 2) for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — enforce CPU/time budgets (fuel + epoch timeout) and add minimal hostcall registry behind a feature flag; keep tests/clippy/fmt green.
- Actions:
  - Enabled fuel and epoch interruption on Engine; set per-invoke fuel via Store::set_fuel and timeout via epoch deadline + background increment
  - Added PluginRunner fields: fuel_budget (default 1_000_000) and timeout_ms (default 500ms); new with_limits_and_budgets(...)
  - Enriched invoke errors with suffix: "(fuel exhausted)" vs "(timeout/epoch interruption)" based on Store::get_fuel() after failure
  - Wired WASI (preview1) with deny-by-default posture; kept optional hostcalls behind `hostcalls` feature; implemented `env::host_log(ptr,len) -> i32`
  - Tests: added fuel_exhaustion_returns_error, timeout_exceeded_returns_error, hostcall_invalid_bounds_returns_error; integration test hostcall_log_integration (feature-gated)
  - Fixed string literal quoting in WAT fixtures; moved misplaced tests into #[cfg(test)] module
- Results:
  - cargo test -p plugin_host: PASS (default and with --features hostcalls)
  - cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check: PASS
  - cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture: PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Wasmtime v24 API uses Store::{set_fuel,get_fuel} (not add_fuel)
  - Timeout via epoch requires set_epoch_deadline + Engine::increment_epoch(); message is generic, so we annotate reason based on remaining fuel
  - Memory cap unit test returns -1 on memory.grow as expected under StoreLimits
- Decision(s):
  - Keep hostcalls behind `hostcalls` feature and minimal (single host_log) to limit surface area; no ambient authority
  - Defaults are fail-closed and bounded: 128 MiB, 1M fuel, 500 ms timeout
  - Observability (metrics/traces) and richer hostcall registry deferred to next polish
- Follow-ups:
  1) Open PR: refactor(plugin-host): fuel/timeout budgets + feature-gated hostcalls (T-6a-E3-PH-03)
  2) Update Issue #3 with REFACTOR Part 2 completion (summary + validation logs)
  3) If approved, squash-merge and proceed to observability polish in a follow-up


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 06:45
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: REFACTOR phase for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — wire WASI sandbox with deny-by-default posture, enforce resource limits, keep tests/clippy/fmt green, and document.
- Actions:
  - Aligned deps to wasmtime/wasmtime-wasi v24.0.4; added pollster for blocking async paths
  - Switched Store state to preview1 WasiP1Ctx; added WASI via preview1::wasi_snapshot_preview1::add_to_linker
  - Enabled async support on Engine; used instantiate_async and call_async with pollster::block_on
  - Added StoreLimits memory cap (default 128 MiB) and unit test asserting memory.grow denial (-1)
  - Updated rustdoc with security posture and limits; kept observability as TODOs
- Results:
  - cargo test --workspace: PASS (all)
  - cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings: PASS
  - cargo fmt --all -- --check: PASS
- Diagnostics:
  - Wasmtime v24 uses async WASI shims; requires Engine Config async_support(true) and async instantiate/call
  - Type for preview1 add_to_linker expects WasiP1Ctx; use WasiCtxBuilder::build_p1()
  - StoreLimits caps effective for memory.grow returning -1 (no trap)
- Decision(s):
  - Defer hostcall registry (host_log) to follow-up to keep scope <50 LoC; document as TODO in Issue #3
  - Fuel/timeouts will be implemented in next polish pass (configurable limits, fail-closed)
- Follow-ups:
  1) Add fuel budget + timeout (epoch/fuel) with tests
  2) Minimal hostcall registry (host_log) behind feature flag
  3) Observability (metrics/traces) for invoke + limits; docs for plugin authoring

- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 05:58
- Area: Runtime (plugin_host)
- Context/Goal: GREEN phase for T-6a-E3-PH-03 — implement minimal Wasmtime-backed runner to load a module and invoke an exported function.
- Actions:
  - Replaced stubs with Engine/Module/Store/Linker implementation
  - Added unit test for missing export error path; kept integration test invoking add(2,3)
- Results: Validations PASS — cargo test -p plugin_host, cargo clippy -p plugin_host -D warnings, cargo fmt -- --check, cargo test --workspace
- Diagnostics: Kept GREEN minimal; WASI wiring deferred to REFACTOR to preserve scope and deny-by-default posture
- Decision(s): Proceed to REFACTOR to add WASI sandbox and resource limits while maintaining security baseline
- Follow-ups: REFACTOR — WASI ctx + add_to_linker, per-invoke fuel, memory cap placeholder, observability TODOs


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 04:58
- Area: Orchestrator|Performance|Docs|CI|Git
- Context/Goal: Add targeted micro-benchmark for VirtualClock::now_ms() to verify ≤200 ns p95 budget (T-6a-E1-ORCH-02), then execute standard end-of-task workflow (merge PR #61, close Issue #2, branch cleanup, sync main).
- Actions:
  - Created `crates/orchestrator/benches/clock.rs` (Criterion) and added `[[bench]] name = "clock", harness = false` to orchestrator Cargo.toml
  - Ran `cargo bench --bench clock` and captured results; updated PR #61 body and Issue #2 with summary
  - Squash-merged PR #61 into main (merge commit: 520f63b); closed Issue #2; deleted branch `feat/virtual-time-clock`
  - Synced main locally; ran validations and formatted benches per rustfmt (commit: 43ca241)
  - Validations: `cargo bench --bench clock` (PASS); `cargo test --workspace -- --nocapture` (PASS); `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings` (PASS); `cargo fmt -- --check` (PASS)
- Results:
  - Benchmark (group: clock_now_ms):
    - virtual_clock_now_ms: median ~4.24 ns; p95 ≪ 200 ns
    - system_clock_now_ms: median ~19.53 ns
    - direct_systemtime_now: median ~19.53 ns
  - Baseline artifacts written under `target/criterion/` for future perf regression checks
  - All AC for ORCH-02 satisfied; main is green post-merge
- Diagnostics:
  - Criterion sample_size set to 1000 for better resolution on sub-20ns paths
  - Process-wide registry read path shows negligible overhead; VirtualClock has no syscalls/allocations
- Decision(s):
  - Accept VirtualClock performance; record baseline and proceed
  - Plan follow-up lint to deny direct SystemTime/Instant in orchestrator
- Follow-ups:
  - Consider explicit `with_clock(...)` constructor for orchestrator in integration tests
  - Add CI perf guard using Criterion baselines when noise thresholds are established


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-25 03:49
- Area: Orchestrator|Determinism|Docs|CI
- Context/Goal: Implement T-6a-E1-ORCH-02 Virtual Time service (Clock trait + Virtual/System clocks) with injection into orchestrator; validate workspace and open PR.
- Actions:
  - Added crates/orchestrator/src/clock.rs with Clock trait, SystemClock, VirtualClock, process_clock()/set_process_clock(), unit tests, and doctest
  - Replaced all orchestrator control-path `now_ms()` uses with `clock::process_clock().now_ms()`; added rustdoc and examples
  - Ran formatting and lints across workspace; fixed replay-cli clippy warnings (option-as-ref-deref, too_many_arguments)
  - Validation: cargo fmt -- --check (PASS); cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings (PASS); cargo test --workspace (PASS); cargo test -p orchestrator --doc (PASS)
  - Opened PR #61 to main with AC mapping and validation results; updated Issue #2
- Results: Deterministic time abstraction in place; all workspace checks green; PR #61 open
- Diagnostics: Doctest import path needed external crate form (`orchestrator::clock::...`)
- Decision(s): Proceed with review; maintain process-wide registry for simplicity; consider explicit DI helper as follow-up
- Follow-ups: On approval, squash-merge PR #61, close Issue #2, delete branch, sync main, append final dev log entry


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:49
- Area: Workflow|Git|Docs
- Context/Goal: Complete merge workflow for T-6a-E1-EL-01 and establish standard end-of-task process for ORCA.
- Actions:
  - Updated code comments in event-log v2 module to reflect completion status (deterministic serialization; golden-tested)
  - Squash-merged PR #60 to main (commit: 1607090de62492abecdb444dfc82f77a481a0a97)
  - Closed Issue #1 with final summary and commit link
  - Deleted feature branch feat/wal-v2-schema (remote and local)
  - Synced local main and validated: cargo test --workspace (PASS)
  - Created new feature branch feat/virtual-time-clock for T-6a-E1-ORCH-02
- Results: Clean merge to main; repo and branches tidy; all tests green on main
- Decision(s): Adopt the following standard end-of-task workflow for all tasks:
  1) Pre-merge quality check: update stale code comments (RED/skeleton/stub → final)
  2) Push and PR: comprehensive description referencing issue and AC
  3) Merge: prefer squash for single-feature branches after validations pass
  4) Close issue: comment with commit link and verification notes, then close
  5) Branch cleanup: delete remote+local feature branch
  6) Sync: pull main locally and re-run validation
  7) Next branch: create from updated main for the next task
  8) Document: append dev log entry with timestamps, actions, results, decisions
- Follow-ups: Apply this workflow consistently for subsequent tasks (next: T-6a-E1-ORCH-02)


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:37
- Area: WAL|Docs|CI
- Context/Goal: Push feature branch and open PR for T-6a-E1-EL-01 (WAL v2 schemas + golden tests), update tracking, and prepare next task.
- Actions:
  - Pushed branch `feat/wal-v2-schema` to origin
  - Opened PR #60 to main: feat(event-log): WAL v2 schemas + golden tests (T-6a-E1-EL-01)
  - Updated Issue #1 with PR link and status (awaiting review)
  - Ran workspace validation: cargo test --workspace (PASS)
  - Maintained scope to event-log + Docs; TODO.md marked complete for this task
- Results: Remote branch created; PR open (https://github.com/ziXnOrg/ORCA/pull/60); tests/clippy pass; fmt note limited to other crates (unchanged here)
- Diagnostics: None new; formatting diffs in other crates pre-exist and are out-of-scope for this PR
- Decision(s): Keep Issue #1 open until merge and verification on main
- Follow-ups:
  - On approval: merge PR; verify on main; then close Issue #1
  - Next task candidate per Quick Start: T-6a-E1-ORCH-02 (Virtual Time service)


- Date (UTC): 2025-10-24 21:15
- Area: WAL
- Context/Goal: Implement T-6a-E1-EL-01 (WAL v2 schemas + golden tests) with deterministic typed serialization and backward-compatibility.
- Actions:
  - Added event_log::v2 typed schema (RecordV2<T>, EventTypeV2, StartRunPayload, TaskEnqueuedPayload, UsageUpdatePayload)
  - Wrote golden fixture and tests: wal_v2_golden.rs (bytes match) and v1_v2_compat.rs (v2 readable via v1 EventRecord<Value>)
  - Finalized Docs/schemas/v2.md with normative field order and invariants
  - Ran validations: cargo test -p event-log, cargo clippy -p event-log; noted workspace fmt diffs to be handled separately
- Results: All event-log tests passing; clippy clean for event-log; golden file stable
- Diagnostics: Serde maps caused ordering mismatch; fixed via typed structs with struct field order
- Decision(s): Keep v2 writer separate; rely on v1 EventRecord to read v2 for now; full version-gating/virtual clock later
- Follow-ups:
  - Add additional variants (policy_audit, run_summary, budget_*) and property tests
  - Wire VirtualClock and wal_v2 feature flag in orchestrator (future tasks)

#### Area
Docs|TODO|Validation|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Validate and improve structural integrity of Docs/TODO.md: deduplicate Quick Start vs Phase 6a, add explicit rule-file citations for traceability across all tasks, fill identified gaps with two new tasks, and open corresponding issues.

#### Actions
- Deduplicated Quick Start: replaced expanded tasks with references to Phase 6a (Docs/TODO.md lines 17–30)
- Added "Rules referenced:" bullets after every "Artifacts & Repro:" across sections (Phase 6a lines ~62, 86, 112, 138, 167, 195, 233, 256; Phase 6b lines ~294, 318, 345, 369, 393, 420, 444, 468, 495, 519, 543, 567, 592, 619, 644; Phase 7 & Global lines ~674, 700, 724, 750, 774, 800, 824, 850, 879, 906, 941, 968, 994, 1019, 1046, 1073, 1125, 1157, 1178, 1196, 1210, 1228, 1249, 1266, 1286, 1304, 1322)
- Added new tasks:
  - T-GB-OBS-SDK-49 (Global/Observability/SDK) with full 11-category structure (Docs/TODO.md lines ~1078–1105)
  - T-CR-REPLAY-02 (Code Review Batch 2) canonical JSON + goldens (Docs/TODO.md lines ~1261–1277)
- Opened GitHub issues: #58 (T-GB-OBS-SDK-49) [labels: global, observability, sdk, risk-low; milestone M12; Depends on #16] and #59 (T-CR-REPLAY-02) [labels: code-review, refactoring, risk-low, crate-replay_cli; milestone M12; Depends on #57]

#### Results
- TODO.md structural integrity improved; Quick Start is canonicalized via Phase 6a refs
- Traceability enhanced: every task now cites applicable `.augment/rules/*.md`
- Gaps filled with two actionable tasks; issues #58 and #59 created and triaged to M12

#### Diagnostics
- Prior duplication between Quick Start and Phase 6a caused ambiguous task ownership; canonicalizing Phase 6a reduces drift
- Rule citations enable auditability against safety-critical standards (determinism, security, perf, observability, testing)

#### Decision(s)
- Adopt "Rules referenced:" as required sub-item for all tasks going forward
- Treat Phase 6a as the single source for Quick Start content; Quick Start remains a navigational index only

#### Follow-ups
- Monitor for any missed rule citations during future task additions
- After implementation PRs begin, ensure new tasks continue to include rule references and acceptance/test gates

#### Area
CodeReview|EventLog|Telemetry|Budget|ReplayCLI|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Batch 2 code review of 4 Rust production files; add CR tasks; open issues with labels/milestone/deps.

#### Files Reviewed (lines; responsibility)
- crates/event-log/src/lib.rs (126) — JSONL WAL (open/append/read_range)
- crates/telemetry/src/lib.rs (162) — logging + optional OTel; budget counters
- crates/budget/src/lib.rs (93) — budget manager, counters, thresholds
- crates/replay-cli/src/main.rs (249) — WAL replay/inspect/trace CLI

#### Strengths
- EventLog typed errors and doc-tests; Telemetry provides JSON logs baseline; Budget API clear and simple; Replay CLI has deterministic output test.

#### Issues (by severity)
- Critical: WAL lacks fsync checkpoints and ordering assertion; monotonicity not enforced by storage [agentic-architecture.mdc; code-standards.md]
- High: Telemetry: init lacks tracer/subscriber hookup; missing redaction and attribute allowlist [observability.md]
- Med: Budget: defaults are permissive (None => unlimited), conflicts with fail-closed posture; no telemetry export [security-privacy.md; rust-standards.md]
- Low: Replay CLI: no schema validation/redaction flags; potential leakage in stdout [security-privacy.md]

#### Decisions
- Create tasks in Docs/TODO.md under Code Review — Batch 2: T-CR-EL-01, T-CR-TEL-01, T-CR-BUD-01, T-CR-REPLAY-01.
- Open issues with M12 and dependencies (#11, #16 where applicable).

#### Issues Created
- #54 (T-CR-EL-01), #55 (T-CR-TEL-01), #56 (T-CR-BUD-01), #57 (T-CR-REPLAY-01)

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: proceed to Batch 3 if remaining files; or begin implementation of high-risk items first (WAL determinism).

### 2025-10-24 07:55 (UTC)

#### Area
CodeReview|Issues

#### Actions
- Created GitHub issues for CR Batch 1 tasks: #49 (T-CR-ORCH-01), #50 (T-CR-ORCH-02), #51 (T-CR-ORCH-03), #52 (T-CR-ORCH-04), #53 (T-CR-POL-01)
- Applied labels per task (code-review, refactoring/tech-debt/security-fix + crate-* + risk-*); set milestone M12
- Added explicit Dependencies in issue bodies (#11, #32, #16 as applicable)

#### Results
- All 5 issues are open and visible; labels correct; milestone M12 assigned; dependency references clickable in GitHub UI

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: proceed to Code Review Batch 2 (next 4–6 files), and open issues for those findings

### 2025-10-24 07:45 (UTC)

#### Area
CodeReview|Orchestrator|Core|Policy|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Batch 1 code review of production Rust files (src/) focusing on safety-critical requirements (determinism, fail-closed), Rust best practices, security, performance, testing, and observability.

#### Files Reviewed (lines; responsibility)
- crates/orchestrator/src/lib.rs (815) — gRPC service, WAL appends, budgets, policy hooks
- crates/orchestrator/src/rbac.rs (19) — RBAC wrapper (Casbin)
- crates/orchestrator/src/tls.rs (41) — mTLS server config (rustls)
- crates/orca-core/src/lib.rs (225) — ids, envelope schema, metadata validation
- crates/policy/src/lib.rs (250) — policy engine (rules, redaction, allowlist)

#### Strengths
- Fail-closed patterns present in RBAC (unwrap_or(false)), budget enforcement, policy deny paths.
- WAL audit events for policy decisions; tracing spans cover key operations; budget metrics wired.
- mTLS configuration requiring client auth; serde-based schema validation in core metadata.

#### Issues (by severity)
- Critical: Event id generation resets after restart (NEXT_ID starts at 1); WAL ids may regress (violates determinism/replay invariants). [rust-standards.md §Determinism; agentic-architecture.mdc]
- High: Wall-clock time used on control paths (now_ms) without virtual clock; record/replay non‑deterministic. [agentic-architecture.mdc; testing-validation.mdc]
- High: Panics/unwraps on control paths (policy.reload, serde). Violates no-panics rule in library code. [rust-standards.md]
- Med: Auth header handling expects raw token; lacks Bearer parsing and constant-time compare. [security-privacy.md]
- Med: RPC envelope kind mapping uses Debug→lowercase ("agentresult"), not snake_case ("agent_result"). API correctness risk. [rust-standards.md]
- Low: Policy engine returns String errors; minimal observability; simplistic rule matching via contains(). [observability.md; testing-validation.md]

#### Decisions
- Create CR tasks T-CR-ORCH-01..04 and T-CR-POL-01 in Docs/TODO.md (11-category structure) with M12 alignment and dependencies on WAL v2/simulation where relevant.

#### Follow-ups
- Await approval to create GitHub issues for new CR tasks and to proceed with Batch 2 (next 4–6 files).

#### Area
Migration|Config|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Global tasks (Batch 2): expand Backward Compatibility & Migration items in Docs/TODO.md and open issues with labels/milestones/dependencies.

#### Actions
- Expanded Global tasks in Docs/TODO.md (3 items): T-GB-BWC-42, T-GB-FLAGS-43, T-GB-RB-44
- Created labels: migration, config
- Opened issues:
  - #46 (BWC-42) — M12 — labels: global, migration, risk-med, crate-orchestrator, sdk — Depends on #37, #38, #39
  - #47 (FLAGS-43) — M12 — labels: global, config, risk-low, crate-orchestrator, crate-policy — Depends on #15, #16
  - #48 (RB-44) — M12 — labels: global, documentation, ci-cd, risk-high — Depends on per-feature tasks (#32–#41, #23/#35)

#### Results
- 3 Global tasks expanded and tracked (#46–#48). Dependencies render correctly in GitHub.

#### Diagnostics
- Flags default OFF (fail-closed), deterministic ring mapping. Migration keeps read-compat and flag-gated write path. Runbooks include prechecks, backout, and evidence.

#### Decision(s)
- Milestone: M12 for alignment with final Phase 7 deliverables and Global Batch 1. Use functional labels for discoverability.

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: commit/push Docs/TODO.md and Docs/dev_log.md updates. Confirm all Global tasks complete and proceed per guidance.

#### Area
CI|Perf|Observability|Security|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Global tasks (Batch 1): expand CI/CD, Performance, Observability, Supply Chain security tasks in Docs/TODO.md; open issues with labels/milestones/dependencies.

#### Actions
- Expanded Global tasks in Docs/TODO.md (4 items): T-GB-CI-45, T-GB-PERF-46, T-GB-OBS-47, T-GB-SEC-48
- Created labels: global, ci-cd, perf, observability, security
- Opened issues:
  - #42 (CI-45) — M12 — labels: global, ci-cd, risk-low — Depends on #15, #16
  - #43 (PERF-46) — M12 — labels: global, perf, risk-med — Depends on #30, #32–#37
  - #44 (OBS-47) — M12 — labels: global, observability, risk-low — Depends on #16, #32–#37
  - #45 (SEC-48) — M12 — labels: global, security, risk-med — Depends on #23, #35

#### Results
- 4 Global tasks expanded and tracked (#42–#45). Functional labels created. Dependencies render correctly in GitHub.

#### Diagnostics
- Perf regression guard relies on stable benches; set noise threshold at 5% and only gate stable scenarios. Coverage gate targets ≥90% overall; core crates ≥90%.

#### Decision(s)
- Milestone: M12 for this batch to align with final Phase 7 deliverables. Supply chain verification set to fail-closed with waiver process documented.

#### Follow-ups
- Next batch: expand Global BWC & Migration items (T-GB-BWC-42, T-GB-FLAGS-43, T-GB-RB-44); then open issues and wire dependencies.

### 2025-10-24 06:55 (UTC)

#### Area
Architecture|Roadmap|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Phase 7 (final batch): expand remaining tasks in Docs/TODO.md with full 11-category structure; open GitHub issues with milestones/labels/dependencies.

#### Actions
- Expanded remaining Phase 7 tasks in Docs/TODO.md (4 items): T-7-E4-COLD-38, T-7-E4-RET-39, T-7-SEC-40, T-7-REL-41
- Opened issues:
  - #38 (COLD-38) — M12 — labels: phase-7, enhancement-4-multimodal, crate-blob_store, risk-med — Depends on #6
  - #39 (RET-39) — M12 — labels: phase-7, enhancement-4-multimodal, crate-event_log, crate-blob_store, risk-low — Depends on #14
  - #40 (SEC-40) — M12 — labels: phase-7, risk-high — Depends on #32–#39
  - #41 (REL-41) — M12 — labels: phase-7, risk-med — Depends on #17, #19, #20, #22–#39

#### Results
- 4 Phase 7 tasks expanded and tracked (#38–#41). All Phase 7 issues present (#32–#41). Dependencies render correctly in GitHub.

#### Diagnostics
- Cross-cutting work (SEC-40/REL-41) placed in M12 to run after core deliverables. Retention verification kept read-only with deterministic ordering.

#### Decision(s)
- Milestones: all four assigned to M12 per Unified Roadmap alignment for E4/cross-cutting items.

#### Follow-ups
- On approval: commit/push Docs/TODO.md and Docs/dev_log.md updates.
- Next: proceed to Global tasks expansion using the same 11-category structure.

Architecture|Roadmap|Docs|Issues

#### Context/Goal
Phase 7 (initial batch): expand tasks in Docs/TODO.md with full 11-category safety-critical structure; create Phase 7 labels/milestones; open GitHub issues with dependencies.

#### Actions
- Expanded Phase 7 tasks in Docs/TODO.md (first batch, 6 items): T-7-E1-SIM-32, T-7-E2-EVD-33, T-7-E2-GDPR-34, T-7-E3-MKT-35, T-7-E3-CAPS-36, T-7-E4-VID-37
- Created label: phase-7
- Created milestones: M9 (E1), M10 (E2), M11 (E3), M12 (E4)
- Opened issues:
  - #32 (SIM-32) — M9 — labels: phase-7, enhancement-1-determinism, crate-orchestrator, risk-med — Depends on #17
  - #33 (EVD-33) — M10 — labels: phase-7, enhancement-2-governance, crate-policy, crate-event_log, risk-med — Depends on #16, #5
  - #34 (GDPR-34) — M10 — labels: phase-7, enhancement-2-governance, crate-blob_store, risk-med — Depends on #6

#### Results
- 6 Phase 7 tasks expanded and tracked (#32–#37). Label and milestones for Phase 7 created. Dependency links render correctly in GitHub.

#### Diagnostics
- Milestone mapping aligned to Unified Roadmap (M9–M12). Cross-cutting tasks and storage lifecycle tasks reserved for next batch to keep batch size ≤6.

#### Decision(s)
- Batch 1 scope: E1/E2/E3/E4 core deliverables only. Cross-cutting (SEC-40, REL-41) and E4 lifecycle (COLD-38, RET-39) deferred to next batch.

#### Follow-ups
- Next batch: expand T-7-E4-COLD-38, T-7-E4-RET-39, T-7-SEC-40, T-7-REL-41; create issues (M12 for E4 items, M11/M12 for cross-cutting per roadmap).
- On approval: commit/push Docs/TODO.md and Docs/dev_log.md updates.

#### Area
Policy|Validation|Precedence|Docs|Tests

#### Context/Goal
Phase 5 Task 2: Add rule priority/precedence, robust YAML validation, and author policy reload design. Maintain compatibility and fail-closed semantics.

#### Changes
- Policy Engine (`crates/policy/src/lib.rs`):
  - Added `priority: i32` to `Rule` (default 0 for backward compatibility).
  - Implemented priority-aware interpreter: evaluate all matches, choose highest `priority`; tie-break via most-restrictive-wins (Deny > Modify > Allow), then first-match for determinism.
  - Preserved ordering: built-in PII redaction → tool allowlist (deny-by-default) → rules.
  - Strengthened `load_from_yaml_path(...)` error handling with descriptive errors and validation:
    - Actions limited to `deny|modify|allow_but_flag`.
    - `tool_allowlist`: non-empty strings, case-folded, duplicates rejected.
    - Optional `transform: regex:<pattern>` validated (compile check).
- Tests (`crates/policy/tests/`):
  - `priority.rs`: three tests covering equal-priority restrictiveness, higher-priority allow over deny, and first-match tie.
  - `validation.rs`: six tests for empty file, invalid action, duplicate/empty allowlist entries, malformed regex transform, and missing fields.
- Docs:
  - Added `Docs/policy_reload_design.md` covering thread-safety, atomicity, error handling, admin API design, security, and testing strategy.

#### Results
- All workspace tests pass (`cargo test --workspace`).
- Policy precedence is deterministic and security-centric (fail-closed tie-breakers).
- YAML loading now rejects malformed/unsafe policies without crashing; previous valid policy persists on reload failures.

#### Follow-ups
- Consider expanding rule conditions beyond simple string contains to structured predicates in a future phase (out of scope for Phase 5).
- Integrate admin reload API (design complete; implementation deferred per scope).

#### Area
Policy|Audit|Orchestrator|Tests|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Phase 5 Task 1: Define and integrate audit event schema; wire policy audit across orchestrator; ensure fail-closed model; prepare for tool allowlists and reload.

#### Actions
- Policy Engine (`crates/policy/src/lib.rs`):
  - Extended `Decision` with `rule_name` and `action` for traceability.
  - Added optional top-level `tool_allowlist` support; implemented deny-by-default enforcement when a tool name is present and not allowed.
  - Preserved PII redaction (regex) and attributed modifications to a rule name (`builtin_redact_pii` or explicit rule).
- Orchestrator (`crates/orchestrator/src/lib.rs`):
  - Made policy engine shared via `Arc<RwLock<...>>`; added `load_policy_from_path()` and env-based auto-reload hooks (`ORCA_POLICY_PATH`, `ORCA_POLICY_RELOAD_MS`).
  - Implemented `append_policy_audit(...)` to emit sanitized audit events with fields: `event`, `phase`, `run_id`, `workflow_id`, `envelope_id`, `agent`, `envelope_kind`, `trace_id`, `rule_name`, `action`, `reason`, `outcome`.
  - Wired audit emission at `pre_start_run`, `pre_submit_task`, and `post_submit_task` (only when there is an intervention: deny/modify/allow_but_flag).
  - Ensured audit payloads never include `payload_json` or other sensitive/PII fields.
- Tests:
  - Added integration-style tests inside orchestrator module verifying audit events for `deny` and `modify` decisions; ensured WAL contains `policy_audit` entries with correct outcomes.
- Docs:
  - Prefixed `Docs/policy.yaml` with a sample `tool_allowlist`.

#### Results
- Policy interventions are now auditable end-to-end via WAL with correlation fields and without leaking PII.
- Runtime policy reload path available; deny-by-default semantics preserved on errors or disallowed tools.

#### Follow-ups
- Task 2: Expand rule interpreter (ordering/precedence), finalize tool allowlist semantics across envelope kinds, and design/admin endpoint for safe runtime reload.
- Task 3: Broaden unit tests in `crates/policy/tests/` to reach ≥90% coverage and include negative/edge cases.


### 2025-10-21 09:01 (UTC)

#### Area
Policy|Audit|Testing|Docs

#### Context/Goal
Kick off Phase 5: implement policy.yaml loader, wire audit events, extend tests and docs.

#### Actions
- Added serde_yaml dep and loader for `Docs/policy.yaml` in `policy::Engine`, with a minimal rule matching mechanism.
- Extended policy engine struct and API to support on-disk policy config and runtime reload.
- Added audit event representation (structs, log points) for `deny`/`modify` matches (no sensitive content in audit fields).
- Created smoke test to parse policy.yaml and check rules are loaded + functional.
- Updated doc references to policy loader and audit log expectations.

#### Results
- Policy engine supports config-driven rule updates; audit hooks ready for Phase 5 extension (tool allowlists, fine-grained moderation).

#### Follow-ups
- Expand on audit log schema, document audit event handling, and add more comprehensive moderation/tool tests.
- Integrate policy reload/admin hook in orchestrator (future Phase 5 step).

- Updated CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) to build `orchestrator` with `--features otel` and build `replay-cli`.

#### Results
- Tests passed locally; CI updated to include optional otel/replay smoke.

#### Follow-ups
- Implement log redaction hooks end-to-end in spans/logs (Phase 5 tie-in).

### 2025-10-21 08:18 (UTC)

#### Area
WAL|Tests

#### Context/Goal
Add determinism-focused tests for replay CLI (filters, ordering, to-trace output).

#### Actions

#### Area
Observability

#### Context/Goal
Harden metrics exporter: real OTLP pipeline, env-configurable, counters/histograms for budgets.

#### Actions
- Aligned OTel deps in `crates/telemetry/Cargo.toml`; enabled `rt-tokio` on SDK.
- Implemented OTLP metrics pipeline with `opentelemetry_otlp::new_pipeline().metrics(runtime::Tokio)`.
- Added counters/histograms: `orca.tokens.total`, `orca.cost.total_micros`, `orca.tokens.per_task`, `orca.cost.per_task_micros`.
- Rebuilt `telemetry` and `orchestrator` with `--features otel`.
- Updated docs `Docs/observability.jaeger.md` with metrics env vars and verification steps.

#### Results
- Build succeeded for telemetry/orchestrator with `otel` feature. Metrics ready for OTLP export.

#### Diagnostics
- Initial build failed due to version mismatches and API changes; fixed by removing `tracing-opentelemetry` for now and using runtime API for metrics.

#### Decisions
- Defer tracing layer hookup to avoid multiple `opentelemetry` versions; keep metrics export minimal and stable.

#### Follow-ups
- Re-introduce tracing subscriber layer once versions are unified and tested.
- Add integration test to assert metrics emission via mock collector.

### 2025-10-21 07:45 (UTC)

#### Area

#### Area
Build|Tests|Runtime|Alignment

#### Context/Goal
Comprehensive alignment review: fix compilation errors, validate all tests, confirm Phases 0-3 + partial Phase 4 complete.

#### Actions
- Fixed Rust toolchain: upgraded to `stable` (supports icu deps).
- Fixed proto serde: enabled `Serialize`/`Deserialize` in `tonic_build`.
- Fixed orchestrator: added missing deps (`policy`, `budget`, `telemetry`, `serde_json`); made `index` public for tests; resolved borrow conflicts in policy/budget paths.
- Fixed event-log: added `Clone` derive to `JsonlEventLog`.
- Fixed integration tests: moved to `crates/orchestrator/tests/`; added `Orchestrator` trait import; fixed `spawn_server` tempdir lifetime; added `futures-util` dep.
- Fixed budget test: adjusted token limits to properly trigger exceeded state.
- Stubbed OTel metrics export (version conflict with `opentelemetry-otlp`; will refine in next iteration).

#### Results
- **Build**: ✅ `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` succeeds (warnings only).
- **Tests**: ✅ 14 tests pass across workspace:
  - `event-log`: 1 test (append roundtrip)
  - `orca-core`: 6 tests (IDs, envelope, metadata validation)
  - `orchestrator` lib: 2 tests (TTL rejection, idempotency)
  - `orchestrator` integration: 2 tests (happy path, TTL timeout)
  - `orchestrator` budget: 2 tests (warn/exceed, isolation)
  - `orchestrator` restart: 1 test (replay rebuilds index)
- **Phase 0**:  Complete (WAL, IDs, telemetry baseline, security stubs, CI, tooling)
- **Phase 1**:  Complete (orchestrator service, proto schema, contracts, TTL/retry, idempotency, WAL integration, tests)
- **Phase 2**:  Complete (SDK docs, metadata model, StreamEvents, recovery, mTLS/RBAC hooks, policy hooks)
- **Phase 3**:  Core complete (usage tracking, budgets, enforcement, metrics, tests); pending docs/SDK finalization
- **Phase 4**:  In progress (span coverage ✅, OTel export stub ✅, replay CLI ✅; pending Jaeger, log enrichment, debug guide)

#### Diagnostics
- Toolchain pinned to `stable` for forward compatibility.
- Proto-generated types now serde-compatible for policy/budget JSON workflows.
- Integration tests validate end-to-end gRPC flows, budget isolation, and crash recovery.
- OTel metrics export: stubbed due to `opentelemetry-otlp` 0.15 API mismatch with `opentelemetry_sdk` 0.22; will align versions in Phase 4 refinement.

#### Decision(s)
- **Toolchain**: Use `stable` channel for production readiness and ecosystem compatibility.
- **OTel metrics**: Stub for now; will wire OTLP exporter in Phase 4 final pass when deps align.
- **Integration tests**: Keep in `crates/orchestrator/tests/` for simplicity (workspace-level tests require separate crate).

#### Follow-ups
- [ ] Complete Phase 3: cost management guide, SDK budget examples finalization
- [ ] Complete Phase 4: Jaeger/Zipkin integration, log enrichment, debugging guide, redaction in traces
- [ ] Align OTel deps and wire real OTLP metrics export
- [ ] Run `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy` before next commit
- [ ] Update CI to run all integration tests
